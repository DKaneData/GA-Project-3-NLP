"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV, and More! [April 22, 2024 - Dead Boys Tell No Tales Edition]","Hey there honorary Justice League members - it‚Äôs a new week which means it‚Äôs time for a new discussion thread!

- Predaplant's pick of the week: [*Detective Comics* #1084](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rmbjtZMUL.jpg)

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week‚Äôs releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too. In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. **Do not post top-level comments**. 

**Keep discussion civil.** Do not harass other users for having a different opinion. Do not use this thread to push your personal one-sided grudges against creators. Reacting to a panel on Twitter is not the same as reading a book.

Wondering, what is the general consensus on Azrael as a character? Is he well-regarded in the fandom? I really liked his introduction with that sword of Azrael storyline, and thought I was going to be a huge fan, but then his midway arc in knightfall was a huge slog for me, and I found myself annoyed by his character.

Not to mention he does the same with Lucifer. Why does this happen, does he actually have a some sort of blessing, talent, mad IQ, or is he just written like that and the writers just nerfs the intelligence of these beings? If it's a written thing, for what purpose is he written like that? Like how superman is written to show hope, justice, the American way, what is Constantine supposed to represent, the wits and resilience of a human being? Can he do the same with all deities or just demons in particular? Because it would be madly insane yet impressive if he can somehow outsmart the big G aka God Himself.",DCcomics,1,0.53
"Let's discuss ""The Long Halloween"" ending, who's actually the Holiday Killer?","Note: lots of spoilers, don't read this post if you haven't read the comic

I just finished reading ""The Long Halloween"" for the second time, and I'm equally puzzled and intrigued by the ending as I was the first time. Everything more or less makes sense until that strange and confusing conclusion. Who is the holiday killer? How many holiday killers are there in total?

One of the theories, and probably the most plausible one, is that we have 2 holiday killers: the first one being Gilda Dent and the second one Alberto Falcone, who continues where Gilda left off. There's no reason to doubt Gilda's confession when she sets fire to Holiday's remains while thinking out loud. So, I believe she actually did commit the murders up until New Year's, wanting to free Harvey from his job and protect the family. This would mean that Gilda killed Johnny Viti, the Irish gang, (although it's debatable how likely it is for one woman to kill a group of mobsters, but in comic logic, I guess it's possible), and Milos, Falcone's bodyguard.

Alberto takes on the role of Holiday after faking his death on New Year's, but that part is somewhat unclear to me. It would take a lot of coincidences for Alberto to pick up where Gilda left off without any agreement or cooperation. But let's chalk up that inconsistency to comic logic as well. 

Throughout the story, Dent's role is the most unclear to me. He claims there are two holiday killers, which is probably the case, but we don't know if he's referring to himself as one of them (as Batman assumes) or to Alberto and his wife. Does Harvey even know that his wife is Holiday? And if we were to include Harvey's killings as part of the ""Holiday killer"" murders, then would we have three holiday killers?

However, I believe Harvey is not the holiday killer; his two murders are solely the result of personal vendettas that happened to coincide on holidays. Gilda still believes Harvey is the second killer, though, while in her logic, Alberto is just a scapegoat taking responsibility for reasons known to him.

The story is quite complicated, and I honestly think the authors got a bit lost in the narrative, making it overly convoluted to the point of creating too many plot holes/leaps, and there isn't a perfectly logical explanation. So, all we're left with is to develop our own theories about what exactly happened and who the killers are. I choose the variant where the killers are Gilda and Alberto, while Harvey only turns evil after becoming Two-Face, i.e., after the accident (although it could be argued that his malice started much earlier, given he knew about his wife's murders) ",DCcomics,48,0.83

What‚Äôs the best way to collect to a point where you aren‚Äôt going overboard?,"My biggest habit I‚Äôve gotten into is I‚Äôll find a character I really like and then all of a sudden I start buying every spin-off that‚Äôs ever been made. Some not even because I want them specifically, but more out of a want for ‚Äúcompleteness‚Äù. Obviously I‚Äôm never going to have all the comics in the world but do you guys have any tips for not going too crazy on comics? I‚Äôm not really sure where the limit is. Like where do you draw the line? I collect Batman, but to be honest idk when I‚Äôll actually look at my shelf and say ‚ÄúI am officially done collecting Batman.‚Äù
