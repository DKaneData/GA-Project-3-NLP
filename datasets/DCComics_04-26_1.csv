Which run(s) had a good romance between Robin/Nightwing and Starfire?,"I'm pretty new to comics (have a hard time getting into them due to the sheer amount of crossovers requiring you to read various other comics), and I've always loved the romance between Robin/Nightwing and Starfire in the animated stuff (shows/movies), so I'm wondering which runs have what I'm looking for.  


I think I heard somewhere that the *Marv Wolfman and George Perez* run had one, but I'm wondering if there was one made more recently.  
I've heard good things about *Geoff Johns'* run, but haven't heard anything about any romance.",DCcomics,7,0.74

Real Lazarus Tournament?,"Who would win if all the best martial artists were brought together? Who would all be there?

Here's my scenario( no killing goes to knock out. No powers)
My 8 (cause it makes even brackets) in no particular order are:
1. Nightwing; I'm a fan boy so I put him first but he deserves to be on this list.
2. Batman; if the guy above is on this list then yah
3. Orphan; duh
4. Lady Shiva; at this point it is a mommy daughter father son play date
5. Deathstroke
6. Richard dragon
7. Connor hawke
8. Black canary
Honorable mentions: bronze tiger, wildcat, karate kid

First round:
1vs8. Dick wins. Black canary is actually pretty easily beaten here. She is keeping up with the fight until dick gets her in a scenario where she would typically use her canary cry. She doesn't but it causes her to hesitate and dick wins

2v7. This one appears to everyone to be a fair fight until batman doesn't take a winning a blow and it becomes clear that he's seeing what Connor can do. After Bruce bears Connor he offers him some advice and training if Connor ever wants it. Connor accepts on the condition he does not have to wear scaly green short shorts

3v6. Idk much about Richard dragon tbh but orphan is goated so she wins.

4v5. Shiva beats deathstroke but deathstroke eggs her on into killing him. Slade is resurrected by the Lazarus pit and sent to the next round as Shiva broke a rule

1v5. Common I'm a nightwing fan boy you know this fight was going to happen. Legitamently the most bloody fight of the tournament. Dick changes his first name to Mark because of how beat up he is after the fight (not actually its an invincible joke). Dick falls many times but always gets back up. At the end Slade asks why and dick Says ""its the reason I fall"" and batman smirks. Slade then forfeits.

2v3. At the start the fight is clearly being won by batman who seems to be getting very angry despite winning. Half way through he stops and calls orphan out for not giving all she has. Batman says she doesn't have to hold back out of fear of hurting him. Orphan lowers her head and then becomes a different animal. This fight is really good with batman relying as much as possible on his strength and constitution, his inner monolgue stating that this strategy is a failing one as he taught her to fight opponents far stronger then him, but that he can't use gadgets or stealth or anything to win this fight. Orphan beats him and afterward walks up to him and let's out a sigh and simply states ""how"" and batman tells her an elaborate way he could have won the fight. Probably using the sand to blind her or something. Orphan then states ""why"" and he says he wanted to fight her as a martial artist. As an equal.

3v1. I am conflicted on this one cause I know how I want to end it but I think it's my fan boy coming out again so I'll give two options.

1. Orphan let's nightwing win because she understands his elevated role in the new dcu and what being the best martial artist in the world would do to help in that role.

2. Nightwing tries to tire orphan out by acrobatically avoiding her, but even exhausted she still manages to win. He admits to being a little let down due to thinking it'd be a better fight. She puts a hand on his chest and says ""good"" and then puts it on her own and says ""better"" and smiles and they have a nice sibling moment to end the series.

Debriefing with the batfamily later has Damian absolutely livid he wasn't invited. Babs and Tim are talking about how martial arts won't mean much with the rate technology is improving. Jason is absolutely roasting dick for losing to a girl after beating the worlds greatest assasin(or in scenario 1 hes roasting him because a girl had to let him win). Steph immediatley implodes at Jason for some unitended sexism. Duke asks Bruce for more martial arts training as he states he thinks out of everyone in the room he'd be the first to lose. He doesn't want to fall behind. ",DCcomics,0,0.3

What to read to understand Crisis on Infinites Earths,"Hi.

I am looking to get back into reading DC comics. I have dabbled throughout the past years reading independent stories (Batman year one, long Halloween, Hush) but was always frustrated with not knowing where to continue. 

I have not read anything for the past 3 years so for all intents and purposes assume I know NOTHING. I am also on a student budget so I cannot read everything, nor do I have the time to do so. 

I have decided I would like to start at Crisis on Infinite Earths (open to suggestions other than this) and would like to know either a few comics I should read to have the needed context or if anyone would like to write the needed context below that would be much appreciated. 

I want to understand the major events in DC continuity (when flash switches, when robin switches, the important events in general) and would like to do so in a condensed way. 

After reading crisis where should I go next? I have heard Perez’s Wonder Woman is great, year 1 etc. 

I would like to read Geoff Jon’s Green Lantern and Flashpoint at some point as well. 

I understand this is a broad question but please don’t suggest “read what you like” I DONT KNOW WHAT I LIKE and would rather understand the most of the DC Universe in as limited amount of time and money as possible. 

Thank you in advance. ",DCcomics,0,0.5

COIE mini-series,"Okay, so I dig the mini-series, especially that the segments use one or two characters as a focal point. A few things don't make sense.  First, I'm having trouble with Batman. He's seemingly the Earth 1 version, yet he didn't take Dick under his scalloped wing, as a result, he appears to have no Bat-family. Then there's the lack of an Earth 1 Wonder Woman, the preeminent female superhero, yet Kara mentions that she is on the satellite when speaking of the E1 Superman and Batman. Black Canary is missing from E1, seemingly never having left E2. Vixen seems to have filled her spot, even in GA's life. Then, there's Amazo and Luthor being the reason the JLA gathered as team. I understand that story had to be modified (a lot) to fit into a relatively easy to follow narrative, but some modifications are so far from the original story that I wish they had changed the name.

Lower the stakes. (a message to DC comic writers and story writers in general),"the existence of superpowered heroes necessitates the existence of superpowered threats in order to produce real stakes. This is the danger in creating strong characters. A strong character needs a strong opponent. they beat said opponent, are proven stronger, and thus an even more powerful opponent is needed for any real threat to be present. This can lead to a lot of mindless power scaling that ultimately becomes meaningless- in the same way that hearing about one tragedy befalling a family often hits harder emotionally than seeing a statistic about hundreds of people being killed. Our brains just can't really comprehend a scale like that. In my opinion, the constant ramping up of stakes cheapens the quality of storytelling. And in itself, the idea that every superhero needs to be ultra-powerful god-adjacent is unnecessary.

Not every hero needs to be extremely powerful, because heroes are allowed to deal with different scales of threats on different levels. Superman is incredibly strong, but he'll never be able to be everywhere, and he won't know how to solve every problem. Heroes can exist that work on a smaller level. (Like the friendly neighborhood spiderman, if he stayed neighborhood level.)

By having heroes that maybe aren't men of steel like Kryptonians, you can have those more personal stories, but they don't *feel* like they don't matter or have low stakes. Sometimes a story about trying to save a pet cat, or to save just one person, can hit a lot harder than one about protecting the globe, depending on the execution. You can still get really gritty and close-to-home with characters fighting for lower stakes. These stories also prop up the bigger ones, because they create anchors in the story for readers to latch onto: A tangible representation of the people these heroes are protecting, beyond just a statistic. It's hard to imagine the entire earth exploding, but knowing that the cat that a lower-level hero went through all that effort to save is going to go away? that's a lot more impactful than a number. 

further, I think that lower-level heroes are really empowering. Because even though said character might not be superman, they're still helping people, no matter how small that effort is, which in itself is heroic. 

And weaker characters can be more than just a one-off mention to convey a message about community or something. You can place focus on lower-level threats, and still keep an audience engaged, as long as the story is compelling.

anyways, this is a plea for writers not to think they have to make every hero a master of their craft, and every villain world threatening. You're allowed to write weaker characters. It can highlight the strength of your powerful characters, and the strength of the relatively weaker ones in their own special ways. You to tell a lot of interesting, more grounded stories. There's a place for world-ending threats in comic book fiction. There's also a place for street-level threats.

I’m writing a fan fic where the Batfamily get Isekai’d into the MHA(My Hero Academia) universe and i need some suggestions  ,"In my fic Damian is a part of Class 1A however I'm having a little dilemma you see I don't know if I should have the rest of the Batfamily be vigilantes that Izuku, All Might, and Nezu all know about but chose not to do anything about or have Nezu and All Might use their connections to get the Batfamily hero licenses. Also how do you think the Batfamily would interact with other major characters like the students in class 1A, Pro Hero's, and villains like the members of the LOV. Also in this fic Batman has a personality similar to the one he had in the animated series that being cold but Compassionate. As for the Batman villains that will be playing major roles they are going to broken up into groups A, B, and C for convineance. Group A which is lead by Joker and has Punchline, Scarecrow and Maybe Killer Moth working for him joins up with the LOV. Group B which is lead by Penguin and has Riddler and Killer Croc working for him joins up with Redestro's group, and finally group C which is lead by Two-Face and has Bane and Clayface working for him joins up with Oberhaul and his Yakuza. How do you think these Batman villains should interact with characters like the LOV, Class 1A, and the Pro Hero's.

Also in my fic the Batfamily consists of Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin/Damian Wayne, and Harley Quinn

Absolute Absolution,"So a few days ago in one thread talking about the new Absolute Comics launch I saw a few posts joking around how weird is going to be when those titles get Absolute editions and we ended up with stuff like ""Absolute Absolute Batman""

But also a very funny one was what if the imprint do at some point an event a la Ultimatum called ""Absolution"" and we get ""Absolute Absolution"". That was very funny.

Today I was reading the description for Al Ewing's Roxxon presents Thor, an issue about a super capitalist version of Thor created by evil corporation Roxxon and there Ewing uses as a joke a fake event called ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTION

The Rumors of Absolute DC,"Its still very recent that the rumors started over this thing. Frankly, I'm open to it; TBH, DC is a very rebooting company, so if you didn't expect this, to quote the James Franco meme: first time, huh? However, this is not seen as a reboot at all, yet feels like it is, or separate.

To clear it up, this is what is know from Bleeding Cool: Absolute DC aka DC All-In will be very close to the hands off/carte blance approach the old All Star line was supposed to have, but to the larger DCU, led by Scott Snyder. So this is not like the New 52, or DC Rebirth, but like Ultimate Marvel; BUT, it won't be separated from the main line, but published in conjunction instead, aiming for a spotlight on DC's entire lineup with this initiative. And above all, still in canon. If true, it would be an attempt to do New 52 right, and be a more ""holistic"" approach with DC Rebirth. And of course, if it is true, we'll hear about it at SDCC 2024.

Because its a rumor and a brand new at that, I wanted to ask two questions for everyone here. 

A) What are people's thoughts on this idea, if true?

And B) Do you believe the tumor is true?",DCcomics,42,0.83
I've gone through the entire comic book history of Batman . AMA,"I've read every major known and some less known Batman comic since his early appearances. I've read the entire runs by Steve Engleheart, O'Neil, Miller, virtually every notable major storyline, every Batman family event comic since the 1990s, Greg Rucka, Morrison, Snyder, Paul Dini, Tomasi, Tom King, (not finished with Zdarsky yet tho so chill), etc.  and rewatched almost every Batman live-action and animated movie (except the really shitty ones i refuse to on moral grounds)

What to read after Robin War,I'm really late to this but I just finished the robin war arc and I'm really curious to see where the thing with Dick Grayson in the parliament of owls goes.

MHA/DC crossover fanfic,"Hi, I'm a longtime DC fan, but a first time poster on this subreddit. This may be a weird post, but for my My Hero Academia ship week fic, the second chapter has Izuku Midoriya (the main character of MHA) as Batman while Ibara Shiozaki (a religious side character in canon with plant powers) as Poison Ivy. I threw in a few references to DC, so if you're interested, [check it out!](https://archiveofourown.org/works/55406863/chapters/140634289#workskin) (You don't need to know anything about MHA to enjoy it.)",DCcomics,0,0.43

New crisis on infinite earths movies is better than the source material ,"Part 1 and part 2 are out now. I’ll start by saying I think part 2 was pretty mediocre, but I thought part 1 was immaculate. More comparisons with the comic when I talk about part 2. 

Lex and Amazo

Part 1 really impressed me. My favorite aspect was how threatening Lex was made out to be. Using parasite and amazo tech to make a super suit made it narratively satisfying when he used it to stand up to the entire justice league. Too often is lex made out to be weak so this depiction of power really resonated with me. Additionally, this is easily my favorite depiction of Amazo. Lex corrupting his programming to make him a villain made Amazo and Ivo a bit more more nuanced than a strong robot and evil scientist. I liked how Ivo was the one who stopped him in the end by getting him to expel his energy.

Clark and Bruce

Another thing I liked about part 1 was the justice league origin. I loved the dynamic between Bruce and Clark. Bruce trusts Clark to keep everything a secret, then gets his identity ousted by Clark needing help. As a big Batman fan, dragging Bruce into a teamwork dynamic was very in character in my opinion. I also liked how the justice league wasn’t formed by some world threatening event. Felt a bit more natural to have it happen due to Clark being a bit clumsy with the secrets.

Diana and Barry

I always thought wonder woman was most tied to WW2 so I like that she is able to have that romance with Steve Trevor while also being apart of the modern world. I’m not the biggest multiverse guy but I enjoyed that being how Wonder woman comes to the team. Love her accent and built aesthic too. Then this is probably my favorite depiction of the flash. Keep in mind I only read Batman. But he was funny and charismatic while not being a clown. His slightly goofy cool guy personality was very well done to me. 

Here’s where I talk more part 2 and comics
Personally I consider the crisis on infinite earths comic to be more history than a great standard of writing. The recruitment of all the heroes takes too many pages and the story looses momentum by focusing on too many realities that just aren’t that interesting. I like how part 2 seemingly relegates all the shadow demons to one film because they get much overstay their welcome in the comics. Like I said earlier, part 2 isn't a good film but I think it depicts the whole tower defense arc of the comics better.

I also think the films are much better at fleshing out the characters of the monitor, harbinger, psycho pirate, and Pariah. They feel like plot devices in the comic and less so characters with nuance. This is one of the biggest pros of the films since the plot essentially revolves around them.

Also the crime syndicate was dope and I have no issue with Lex's kid being removed. Just made the comic more convoluted anyways

Hot take on Identity Crisis and what happened to Doctor Light (spoilers for the comic below),"So we all know Doctor Light was made into a rapist and had to be lobotomized by the JLA. 

My basic hot take/question is; 

Am I seriously the only person who struggles to see how ""lobotomizing the guy"" is somehow worse than letting him go on to rape Sue again. I mean come on what would you have done, would you have just sat by and let it happen. 

Anyway I already know that this is the unpopular opinion on this subreddit and this post will be downvoted to oblivion but surely there is at least one person who agree it was the better option. A woman was raped and I'm 70% sure he not only was gonna do it again he also threatened to do it to the Flash's wife after he found out who she was. 

The basic premise of the story is how the JLA  betrayed Batman but maybe because I'm not as crazy about Batman as I was maybe 10 years ago but I find it so hypocritical how he has the nerve to talk about being betrayed when bro has a hit list on all his friends and is spying on them 24/7 with brother eye. I mean sit there and actually think about that. One of your friends having a hit list on you and all your fellow friends and everything you do he is just spying on you. 

The rest of the Jla are always written to forgive Batman no matter what he does and he is never in the wrong or the story will always bend over backwards to justify whatever he does (pretty sure Identity Crisis was written just to justify tower of Babel) but when it's the other way around they have to seek his forgiveness and all admit how wrong they were. It really just makes Batman unlikable for me and makes me wish he'd just stick to Gotham.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I sidetracked myself this post was about Doctor Light and my point is pretty straightforward. Yeah if there was a better option then lobotomizing a man no matter how evil is pretty fucked up but there was no better option (except killing the guy) and so given the context of the situation I don't think the rest of the JLA have anything to feel sorry for. It's like feeling sorry that you locked up a criminal because you are no better than a kidnapper...obviously you are. You are doing it for the greater good and the 2 scenarios are not the same. So yeah that's my post, I'll read all your comments if anyone bothers to respond",DCcomics,6,0.57

[Discussion] Whats your opinionated pinpoint of retrospective on New 52 Wonder Woman that you find the least appealing?,"
Here’s my least favourite thing on new 52 Wonder Woman-the Major disappointment of the New 52 version of Wonder Woman was clearly her cliché romance with Clark. Diana, who should embody strength and empowerment, was reduced to nothing more than Clark's trophy. It's ridiculous and ludicrous that they thought a tired, cliché relationship would suit Clark's character. Worse yet, whenever they were together, Diana was clearly portrayed as a flipping weakling and submissive. Looks like the New 52 writers clearly dropped the flippin’ ball on understanding Wonder Woman's character.

Part 2 to my post. ,"(Sorry in advanced if I’m getting annoying with all these questions) 

I previously posted like 2 days ago. Asking for a list of EVERYTHING in New 52 &amp; how to read it. 

Based on the comments, I wanna clarify/change some things. 

People said that reading EVERYTHING isn’t recommended because apparently most of it is boring/bad. 

So ig I’ll just stick to DC characters I like. My top 5 ig would be (it’s wierd, Ik) but Batman, Nightwing, The Flash, Green Arrow, &amp; Beast Boy/Teen Titans. So ig my new questions are…  

1. Since I’ve already started collecting a lot of New 52 TPB’s from those characters, so the completionist in me wants to finish those, &amp; I do plan on getting the Rebirth runs of those characters. 

But is there a specific list of like everything batfamily related? Cause the lists that I’ve seen are detailed, but are missing some runs. Like I don’t see Batman Eternal or Batman &amp; Robin Eternal. &amp; those are just the ones I know about. But what other runs am I missing that’s also missing on the lists yk? &amp; I’m also asking about other runs that include those characters or are universe events that affect everyone (like I think Future’s End) 

2. What are some stories or runs that are good to read that focuses on those characters, sure I’d like the recommendations like Hush, Long Halloween, etc. but doesn’t necessarily have to be the “popular” stuff. &amp; it doesn’t necessarily have to be one book stories. I don’t mind collecting runs that are like 6+ TPB’s. 

3. I’m confused on Rebirth. Ik that flashpoint basically reset DC into the New 52, but after fans not liking the new 52, they re-reset the continuity with Rebirth. 

So my question is, is rebirth a continuation of whatever stories were being told before DC did Flashpoint? Or is it a FULL reset where I could start reading rebirth from the beginning without having to read older pre-flashpoint runs? &amp; also, what is Rebirth’s version of Flashpoint? Like what storyline caused the reset in-universe. 

&amp; lastly. I’ve heard different explanations of Rebirh. Half say it’s a reboot of New 52, but it’s also a continuation, like to get the FULL FULL story, read both New 52 &amp; Rebirth, like those characters still remember they’re New 52 versions, but went through changes for Rebirth. But the other half say Rebirth has NOTHING to do with New 52. It just kills off New 52 completely &amp; starts from scratch. Which is it? ",DCcomics,0,0.3
The new teen titans important events,"I have been reading the new teen titans (the Wolfman and perez run) and got pretty far, but I just don't think it's for me. I got through Dick's transformation into nightwing and the judas contract and now I'm just past the second fight with trigon (around #10 of part 2 of the series). I'm wanting to explore more nightwing and future teen titans runs but I want to know what major events I would be missing if I didn't finish this whole series. For example I read the first few issues of the 1996 nightwing by Chuck Dixon and Dick mentions something about his last relationship ending in a funeral. Are there certain issues I should read and just skip through the rest? ",DCcomics,0,0.4
