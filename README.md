# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

### Description

In week five we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week six we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project will put those skills to the test.

For project 3, your goal is two-fold:
1. Using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
2. You'll then use various NLP techniques to process your data before training a range of classifiers to determine where a given post came from.


#### About the API

In 2023, Reddit proposed and underwent a series of changes to its API that greatly affected the ways that users, developers, and academics interact with and access the troves of data that its community freely creates.

While the cost of data storage cannot be ignored, the monetization of its API has led to a shutdown of massively popular third-party and stifled [important research](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=reddit&searchtype=all&source=header) in the social sciences (community formation/network analysis, hate speech, discourse analysis, etc.), cybersecurity (bot detection), and—importantly for us this week—the very large and diverse world of natural language processing (semantic analysis, translation, topic modeling, disambiguation, relationship extraction, etc).

While APIs like Pushshift that collected and stored Reddit's data from its inception are no longer accessible, we can still retrieve a limited amount of data directly from [Reddit's API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/). As with anytime you begin interacting with a new tool, you should familiarize yourself as much as possible with the documentation.

**We will do a walkthrough of how to access and submit a simple request to the Reddit API together.**

## Checkpoints and Advice

If you aren't familiar with [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), go check it out and browse different subreddits. Each subreddit is like a forum on a different topic. [Here's a list of subreddits by topic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/listofsubreddits)

Data Choices
- In your project you can classify posts, comments, titles, or some combination of those things. What you choose will partly determine how difficult your data cleaning will be and how challenging the classification task will be for your algorithms. In your presentation and executive summary, **tell us what you used**.
- You can also include other information from posts or comments as features, but you must include some text.

Subreddit Selection
- The more similar the subreddits are, the more challenging (and interesting?!) your project will become.
- Choose your subreddits as soon as you can and let us know your choices.  Consider the breakdown of the post count for each as well.

Data collection
- You should have a script written to retrieve data from your subreddits of choice as soon as possible. Because the API only allows us to retrieve 1000 of the most recent new and popular posts at time, this script should be written so that you can execute it from the command line at regular intervals.
- The more data you can pull the better for your classifier. **Ideally you will want data from at least 3000 unique, non-null posts from each subreddit.**

### Requirements

- Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library in a Python script.
- Script suggestions:
    - First time it runs:
        - Gets user input on subreddits they want to collect information from
        - Asks user for their API credentials
        - Stores this information in a JSON file
    - Submits requests to API until maximum number of posts have been retrieved
    - Writes/appends post data to a singular file
    - Creates and updates a transaction log recording the number of posts retrieved per script execution, the datetime of its execution, and the total number of posts retrieved to date
        - This would ensure that the script was executed over several days' time
    - Other considerations
        - Added functionality to drop data you are confident you will not want for EDA or modeling
        - Added functionality to drop duplicate posts from each successful round of API requests
        - *Advanced bonus*: schedule a process for the script to be run automatically at regular intervals to avoid having to do it manually
- **Create and compare at least two models**. These can be any classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest Classifier, etc.
  - **Bonus**: use a Naive Bayes classifier
- Try to **build a robust commit history** on GHE for this project.
- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a **peer audience of data scientists.**
- An executive summary of your results.
- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience, shoot for **8 minutes**.

**Pro Tip:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Code and executive summary must be in a clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.
- You must submit your slide deck.
- Deadlines:
    - **Materials submitted**: 9 AM PST, Monday, January 8th
    - **Presentation**: 930 AM PST, Monday, January 8th

### Why did we choose this project for you?
This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.

Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).

Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.

Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.
