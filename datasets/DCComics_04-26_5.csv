"To me, the best Superman story of all time is Kingdom Come"," I remember first buying the hardcover edition which contained the whole series sometime in 1996 or 97 while I was on deployment in the Navy. Read it multiple times and it has stayed with me ever since.

And the reason why I think it's the best Superman story is because it didn't take the low hanging fruit approach, which is making Superman dark and edgy, or making him bewitched by red kryptonite or whatever.

Instead, Superman lost faith in society because society had lost faith in him. To me, this is profound. Superman's powers have always come not from the yellow sun, but by the people's faith in him that he would always do the right thing. He was the ideal we aspired to, even if we knew we never really could.

That loss of faith lead Superman to exile himself, and leave the world to its own fate. My reaction to that today is the same as it was back then: *Holy crap!*

Even back in the 90s, Superman was seen as a dinosaur with outdated morals and principals. Society wanted darker and grittier heroes who would kill bad guys on sight. They wanted more heroes like Batman and The Punisher (even though he's from Marvel).

The entire story was about how Superman and the classic members of the Justice League - including Batman! - gathered up all the new age superheroes and tried to show them what it meant to actually be a superhero. It was such an amazing story, and I don't really see writing like that today when it comes to Supes.

I have no idea what the new Superman movie will be about, but I sincerely hope at some point, someone tells a Superman story similar to that. Not just him saving the world from Zod or Darkseid, but grappling with an enemy more powerful than all of them: loss of hope.

Do something like that, and you can kindly STFU and take ALL my money.",DCcomics,24,0.75
I need help finding a comic book,"It's about the dark knight returns batman meeting both superman and batman (this batman wearing the neal adams batman suit).

A plot idea for a Mr. Freeze Solo Movie,"Inspired by some old posts I found on this sub-reddit and the less than optimistic response to my recent post on WB producing solo character driven movies for DC villains like Mr. Freeze, I decided to come up with a short plot of what a potential Mr. Freeze solo movie could be.

Let me know what you're all think:

In the heart of Gotham City, lived Victor Fries, a brilliant scientist whose life was forever altered by the warmth of love and the cold embrace of loss.

The movie begins with a glimpse into Victor's past, a time when he was not yet known as the notorious Mr. Freeze. In those early days, he was a man of science, devoted to his research and driven by a relentless curiosity about the world around him. But amidst the sterile confines of his laboratory, there was a spark of humanity that set him apart – the love of his life, Nora.

Nora was unlike anyone Victor had ever known – a beacon of light in his otherwise solitary existence. With her gentle smile and kind heart, she thawed the icy walls Victor had built around himself, bringing warmth and joy into his life. Their romance blossomed slowly, like a delicate flower unfurling its petals in the warmth of the sun.

As the movie unfolds, we witness the tender moments shared between Victor and Nora – picnics in the park, late-night stargazing sessions, and stolen kisses in the moonlight. Their love is a force of nature, binding them together in a bond that transcends time and space.

But even the brightest flames are not immune to the chill of adversity, and tragedy soon strikes the young couple. Nora falls gravely ill, her once vibrant spirit dimmed by the specter of a deadly disease. As her condition worsens, Victor's world is plunged into darkness once more, his heart heavy with the weight of impending loss.

Determined to save the woman he loves, Victor throws himself into his work with renewed vigor, searching tirelessly for a cure to Nora's illness. Days turn into weeks, and weeks into months, but still, he refuses to give up hope. His laboratory becomes a sanctuary of sorts, a place where science and love intertwine in a desperate bid for salvation.

But fate is a cruel mistress, and despite Victor's best efforts, Nora's condition continues to deteriorate. As her life hangs in the balance, Victor is faced with an impossible choice – to accept defeat or to defy the laws of nature itself. And so, with a heavy heart and a determined spirit, he embarks on a journey that will forever alter the course of his destiny.

The romantic part of the movie is not merely a subplot but the very heart and soul of the story, illuminating the depths of Victor and Nora's love and the lengths to which they will go to protect it. Theirs is a love story for the ages, a tale of passion, sacrifice, and redemption that will linger in the hearts of audiences long after the credits roll.

If WB could greenlight films such as "" Isn't it romantic"" , "" A Hollywood Christmas"" and "" Locked down"", I see no reason why they can't give this a serious consideration.

[other] Looking for a specific Green Lantern comic which i can't find anymore.,"When i started reading the green lantern i found myself reading a retelling of sorts of Hal Jordan. It told his origin story and how he became a lantern. Then, it was about a science guy who's head got blown out of proportions because of some alien tech, and Atrocitus (I believe, red demon like monster from the red lantern corpse who escaped) reaching earth. Sinestro (as Hal's mentor) and Hal were working together to piece it all together and fight Atrocitus.   


I remember needing to buy the next volume, lending out that specific run to friends of mine, but lost contact and forgot about it all. Now i want to get back into the green lantern and im REALLY trying to find this run but i cant for the life of me. Its not rebirth, i know it had something to do with secret files and origins i think, but its all very fuzzy.   


Hopefully some smart people on here can help me figure out what im talking about.",DCcomics,2,0.63

Naomi No More,"Anyone else notice how Naomi just stopped existing?

It’s been over a year since she’s been sighted (Dark Crisis issue 1) despite there being like three events since

She just vanished with Bendis I guess. 

Weird considering how hard they tried to push her. From Young Justice to the full fledged Justice League in no time, and her own show. 

Now, nowhere to be seen. Usually characters dipping into the background aren’t so heavily used before they disappear without a trace. No mention whatsoever

That said, I’m sure that in a year I’ll be able to say the same about Clownhunter and Ghostmaker, but they weren’t as heavily pushed.",DCcomics,31,0.84
Who didn't really like Watchemen the movie,"Honestly i didn't enjoy to watch it because it was boring, no much sense and long.

I didn't really like as much characters as much appart the blue guy and the detective were quite all right . The rest  of people was garbage.

Basicaly Synder copied everything pretty much  on Justice League ,that is  one reason I hated it.

It is also one of this comercial film with the same silly script. Always the good guy vs the villains. That's tirering.

Some q's about YJ and KonCass,"So for the past week or so, I've spent a lot of time reading old serials of pre-flashpoint YJ and new 52 Teen titans, namely because of how Cassie and Conner (even Kon) are some of my favorite legacy characters (second only to the fab5). As such I have a few questions to ask. 1) Does Cassie remember the new52? I know Tim does. 2) Does no one remember Kon-El? Even Cassie? I mean she was kinda in a relationship with him.  Basically I don't get how Kon-El just randomly disappeared after all the adventures he had and how the titans just forgot about him, ik its something about harvest. 3) this is prob a common question but do you guys think we'll ever get KonCass again? I really wanna see them again and since Dawn of DC has been reviving lost relationships (DickBabs, HalCarol), can they also get revived? They haven't announced a dawn of DC YJ series yet although it makes sense why because of the Titans being the flag front. One more thinggg, have they announced a dawn of dc supergirl series because I am so confused on her origin story and if the thing about Zor-El being cyborg superman is still canon coz Zor-El got revived pre-flashpoint too.",DCcomics,0,0.33

(Getting back into Comics) Looking for some community recommendations and sign posting," I have always been a very casual comic hobbyist when I was last reading at the start of Rebirth. I am looking for some recommendations from the community, I know I can get some of the answers from Google, but am looking for some human experience and feedback. So if anyone could take the time to answer/give their opinion on one or more of my questions that would be fantastic.

Current and Historical reads:

Anything Superman(Inc. family stuff)

Constantine (Reading Marks of Woe, and the best version of you)

Injustice (Read all 5 years I believe)

Preacher (Book one TPB in post)

   
 Q1: I read roughly the first quarter of nearly everything DC Rebirth, but never experienced any of the big reveals. Do you think it's worth revisiting, if so is there a recommended order and set of TPB you can recommend?

Q2: What is the current continuity?  is it linked to Rebirth at all? Is the current line of books well-perceived and worth looking into?

Q3 My Missy watched the Sandman TV show without telling me or being aware it was comic adjacent and loved it. She has never read a comic in her life, and I have not read Sandman in the past (I'm aware my current read of Hellblazer is Sandman universe) is there a current line of Sandman TPB I can buy for her to enjoy? Happy for stories told in the TV show or not.

Q4: Appreciate this is not an exact science, but further recommendations for other books/lines my partner might enjoy if she enjoyed Sandman? (seems to like the concepts of the endless and Biblical stuff)

Q5: Swamp Thing have you read it and would you recommend it? would you start from the start or jump into a newer line (if it exists) TPB recommendations and general advice / pre-reading appreciated.

Q6: What is considered a hot comic line currently, wither you agree with it or not?

Q7: I seem to prefer the Vertigo, Black label lines( from my limited experience) can you recommend any books you personally love, can be any character and I will consider it for future reads.",DCcomics,3,0.67
