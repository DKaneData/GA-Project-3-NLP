"Hello, I need some directions- Never read comics before","Heya, so I need some directions- I want to read some batman comics because I really like the character, but I dont particularly enjoy superhero stories, its just batman specifically that I found a really fun concept.

I'm more of a realistic-high fantasy person, because of that I know very little about the comics, I have watched popular dc movies but nothing really more than that.

This is why I wanted to ask you where one should start from my position when reading batman comics, I'm not likely to read a lot of them (hell I'd want to but I just know myself well enough to know it wouldnt happen), I'm just in the middle of Malazan and wanted to try something different, so I'd appreciate a recommendation of maybe three titles I could possibly read that could show me the best of this character.

Hope thats something reasonable to ask üòÖ I know there are hundreds, probably difficult to pick  so few, I would however not mind if you recommend a specific series as a single title.",DCcomics,0,0.44

Question about Zdasky‚Äôs Batman run ,"Hi all ‚Äî tried to post this question in r/batman but was auto-removed because my account is too new. 

So, my quick question is about the Gotham War arc ‚Äî how important is it to the story or can it be skipped? 

The reason I‚Äôm asking is I picked up first two trades (Failsafe &amp; Bat-man of Gotham) + Mindbomb, Joker Year One &amp; Dark Prisons in singles. 

The trade for the Gotham War comes out closer to July and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd be better off to wait and read altogether when it comes out to make sense of the overall run; or to just skip it completely if it‚Äôs not crucial to the story (and apparently bad anyway?)",DCcomics,5,0.78

Batman current state,"Hey everyone.

I was out of comics for some time and I thought that it is time to come back.

I finished reading Batman around the time New 52 turned into Rebirth. And I know since then it turned into Future State.
So here is my question. What to read to catch up? I care about very little about Batfamily (apart from bigger crossovers). So I want to focus on Batman main title, Detective Comics, and bigger events (Heroes in Crisis, Doomsday clock, Death Metal?). But when to read them? I want to catch up until current state.

"Screw your favorite run, what‚Äôs your most hated run (or miniseries) on a character you really like","I‚Äôll start off with two. 

1. Chuck Austen‚Äôs Superman man. Want a Superman run written by a guy who really DOESN‚ÄôT like Superman? Not a doesn‚Äôt get or wants to change Superman for different times, I mean full on does not like him? You got Chuck‚Äôs run. Where he battles his arch enemy, Repo Man, The Kingdom Gog, and his own wife in a battle for truth, Justice, and really being angry and mean at everyone. Superman is very downright unpleasant this run, and it‚Äôs actually really funny how much of a jerk he is. How LAME his villains are, from a Doomsday who is more like Lenny from Mice and Men to the invincible unstoppable omnipotent Repo Man! This is a run I have plenty of fun laughing at, but actually reading it is a painful chore. 

2. Vendetti Flash. I like Vendetti, but man did not get how to write the Flash. Everything is just wild and seems to be just throwing stuff at the wall, a Reverse Flash who is near nothing like Eobard and nothing like Hunter, a police captain who now hates the Flash for the crime of BEING REALLY FAST, and a random Riddler arc slammed into it. Nothing works in the run, from Wally‚Äôs character arc to anything Iris did to Henry Allen suddenly breaking out of jail to kill some guy who he apparently hated. It‚Äôs far more enjoyable than Austen‚Äôs run and while not as bad, is rather just incompetent.

[Discussion] Just finished reading Benjamin Percy's run on Green Arrow," Been meaning to check out this run for a while now and I finally did. 

Overall, I'd say it was good, with a stretch of it (volume 4 and 5) being legit great. I think Percy gets the essence of the character, which is always essential imo. There is nothing groundbreaking in his run but its generally solid. I preferred the art when it is handled by Otto Schmidt, but the other artists did a good job too. I'll always appreciate ""fighting the bigget man"" storylines, so it was nice seeing Ollie's rebirth over the course of the run.

Unfortunately I thought the last volume was super rushed, with major pacing issues and soap opera-esque plot twists and character beats that kinda soured what came before.

Personally, I don't mind this decision. It allows for more creative expressions between each property, allowing the filmmakers of both projects to not worry about continuity between films and whatnot. I mean, if they were in the same universe, that would be Batman would fight a very old Joker, seeing as how he was already an adult in his movie, with Bruce still a child. You'd be hard pressed to make a compelling Batman vs Joker story with that premise (maybe an interesting comedy perhaps).

Earth 3 Counterpart Suggestions?,"For those of you who don't know, Earth 3 is a universe where heroes are villains, and vice versa. It's ruled by the Crime Syndicate, with Ultraman being evil superman, Owlman being evil Batman. Do any of you all have ideas for these alternate counterparts for characters?  


I'll post two of my ideas below.  


Bioluminescence is the alternate version of Black Manta that is a sort of ""champion of two worlds"". David Hyde was born as a child of two worlds, to two humans on the surface that quickly became enamored with Atlantis. I see Bioluminescence as a sort of freedom fighter against the reign of Sea King, and filling the same ""hero of both worlds"". He's almost a comedically good person, having a strong code against killing, and pretty much dedicating his life to try and redeem Sea King into a good king and leader for his people, while helping for small groups of Atlanteans that live against his rule.  


The Gull is the alternate version of the Penguin that was a formerly wealthy. Oswald Cobblepot was a  bleeding heart millionaire that ran afoul with corrupt billionaire Bruce Wayne, who managed to cheat him out of most of hi, forcing him to go underground. He rose up as the Gull- an underground psuedo mob boss that has become something of a hero for the city's underprivileged. He operates through informants of the city's lowest- vagrants and the homeless, those who Owlman nor the corrupt GCPD pay much attention to, gathering information to hopefully drive his fascistic reign to an end.

What ideas do you have?",DCcomics,0,0.5

The basic plot from what I can remember: Bruce was hallucinating Jason Todd and Tim Drake as Robin was driving next to the batmobile (or was the one driving the batmobile). Tim was wearing goggles. Then they get to the batcave and fight? Alfred was mentioned or might've shown up.

[Discussion] The ‚ÄúEarth Day Collection‚Äù in DCUI app unintentionally creates a fun new environmental super team,"DC Universe Infinite has a collection of comics and character spotlights themed around Earth Day, and I thought the characters listed would actually make a cool offbeat, environmentally-conscious team book. Obviously, there‚Äôs some redundancy in powers, but the interpersonal dynamics would be very fun. Maybe this is a team that doesn‚Äôt mind breaking international law if it means securing victory on behalf of Mother Earth, which occasionally puts them at odds with the main Justice League.

Anyway, I would totally give a mini or ongoing featuring ‚ÄúJustice League Earth‚Äù or whatever they‚Äôd call it a fair shot. Are there any other characters you could see adding or swapping in?

Starro the Conqueror (modern take),"So with the advent of a licensed table-top roleplaying game (TTRPG) from the ""other publisher"", I've taken it upon myself to make custom DC characters playable within it.  I've a question about Starro the Conqueror: is his modern concept still the giant alien starfish that continues to grow in size with the more beings he controls?  I saw some indications of a humanoid-looking Starro and was wondering if this is the modern-day Starro, a sort of ""avatar"" of Starro, etc.  This thread has been quick to response before and I really appreciate it!

Incidentally, is anyone familiar with the aforementioned TTRPG from the big ""M""?  And if so, are you interested in seeing any of my DC builds for it?  I've made a bunch on Demiplane and more in the works, but it helps if you have the aforementioned game and some familiarity with it, as the stat blocks are a little unconventional from previous superhero RPGs.

Thanks again in advance, and please don't hate me!!  I want to represent DC well as a valuable resource for those interested!",DCcomics,0,0.5
