How many of you here are into manga and comics both ?,"As I have mentioned in my old post I'm a old comics fan I used to read comics a lot during my teenage years both DC and marvel but I stopped when I got into anime/manga and been reading only manga since then but lately I have been getting the feeling to return to comics which I kinda did I picked up Superman 90s comics also action comics 90s since I didn't read his 90s comics in the past I've only read his 2000s, new 52 and rebirth

My thoughts on Phoenix Saga,"**Let me preface this by saying that this is the first time I have ever read an X-men comic of any kind. My experience with the X-men is solely due to the various animated shows and movies. After years of watching the MCU I decided to read Marvel comics. I decided to start with X-men because I felt like the animated offerings were good to great but the movies, most of the time, were bad. I wanted to see what they were actually like.**

**Now this doesn’t mean I am oblivious to X-men. I am proud to be a pretty nerdy guy so over the last 33 years of my life I have stumbled on comic art, comic book covers, and what I would consider light spoilers over that time.**

**After doing some research I decided to start from the very beginning for two reasons. 1) I thought it would be interesting to see how these characters change and evolve over time. 2) The original X-men comic was canceled which meant I didn’t have to read 200+ issues to hit Uncanny X-men. I only had to make my way through 66.**

**Previously I did review, or at least, my thoughts on the original X-men run.**

[https://new.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1buud2a/my\_thoughts\_on\_silver\_age\_xmen\_maybe\_light/](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1buud2a/my_thoughts_on_silver_age_xmen_maybe_light/)

**If you are not interested in reading that, to sum it up, I overall liked it. Way more than most people like The Silver Age X-men. I originally was going to do my thoughts on Uncanny X-men Omnibus vol 1 but I decided to forego that and instead do my thoughts on The Phoenix Saga which I am counting as staring on issue #101 and going up to #138**

**So without further ado let's get to it.**

Issue 101: I have seen the cover of this issue before. The phoenix bursting out of the water. I know the loose cliff notes version of the Phoenix saga in comics. This was my first time actually reading the story though and I will have to say the first couple pages are what I expected. Jean Grey crashed into the ocean before bursting forth from it. What I didn’t expect was afterwards her ending up in a hospital bed as Cyclops stays by her side, the others go on a vacation.

Honestly that was my biggest surprise about the Phoenix Saga how long it lasted. I could only imagine what it must have been like picking it up as they came out. Overall a great start to the Phoenix Saga.

Issue #105-#108: I have no idea if this is a hot take but after reading this arc and thinking back to the silver age I have realized something. I do not like when the X-men deal with aliens or go into space. I don’t even know what to say about this arc really. The alien civil war did nothing for me and finding out Cyclop’s dad was Corsair was a neat idea but I am about twelve issues into the Uncanny Omnibus Vol 2 now and nothing has come of this yet. The ending was cool was the phoenix but other from that… eh.

**So the rest I will kind of shoot off the top of my head as the rest of what happens with Phoenix is kind of scattered and peppered throughout.**

Jason Wyngarde was a very intriguing and interesting villain as is the idea of the black queen. The only question I have is… did he really not know she was phoenix? Why did he just want Jean Grey? When the Phoenix kills him I believe it is Cyclops that says that Jason had no idea Phoenix was a thing but I swear Jason was also the one that said that he had accounted for her getting mad and upset after he attacked Cyclops. It was cool to see Mastermind again though.

Cyclops went from my least favorite X-men to one of my favorites. Same with Wolverine. In the beginning of Chris Clarmont’s run I couldn’t help but wonder why Wolverine was so darn popular. By the time the volume 1 omnibus concluded I understood it. I would also like to do a re-read one day where I track when Wolverine went from being an unruly asshole to giving off more loveable drunken uncle vibes.

Storm is easily my new favorite x-men. Enough said.

Ok. Enough mucking around let's talk about the actual event. I understand why the phoenix saga is so beloved now. A true epic. Do I believe that there are better stories that have taken place in the comic medium since? Yes. For the time though I understand why this was such a big deal and why people hold it in such high regard. The last five issues or so when the X-men walked into the hellfire club to Cyclops recounting his time as an X-men and walking off is easily one the best stories I have had the pleasure to read. That is to say nothing of everything else.

I think the only thing I was slightly confused on is what Phoenix was exactly? Me reading issue after issue may have fuzzed some details. However, I can’t help but ask… It came from the solar flare, correct? It was obviously some cosmic entity and not like the movies portray where it is a part of her? If anyone can give me some insight into this that would be nice.

All in all I would give it 8.5.",Marvel,0,0.25

Small review for Ultimates 1&amp;2,"I always watched the ultimate avengers movies religiously as a kid, which made me want to read this series in the first place. It wasn’t the train wreck that I initially thought to be. I wouldn’t call them good, but entertaining. Some of the costume designs were questionable to say the least. I absolutely loathe the iron man suits. I thought all his suits were abysmal. I like how they made Bucky into an old man and not the winter soldier in this universe. The relationships in this series are hit or miss. I wasn’t invested in any of it. Jan, Hank, and Black Widow are fucking dicks, so I have no interest of what’s happening to them. Black Widow being the mole for the team was predictable for me idk about everyone but as soon as it was told that there was a mole in the team. I enjoyed it overall, I wouldn’t mind rereading it, but I have some questions down below? 

Was this the comic book series that made Nick Fury black? 

Where Hank Pyms position in all this? It’s very confusing which side he was in the ultimates 2 storyline.

Steve Englehart helped introduce Beast to the Avengers in the 70s, and several of his successors kept Hank on the team until the early 80s.

*"" ABOUT AMAZING SPIDER-MAN BY ZEB WELLS VOL. 11: GOING GREEN* 

***Zeb Wells’ highly talked-about Spider-Man run reaches a climax with the return of the Green Goblin!***  
*The greatest villain in Spider-Man history is back, and about to remind Spider-Man — along with all of us — exactly why he’s so feared! And as if the Goblin isn’t enough, the Sinister Six are here too — along with several other problems that will soon destroy Spider-Man’s life once and for all!""*

You guys feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but, with everything that's happened so far and what's yet to be resolved, we have the following: 

Tombstone's Plan for Spidey

Peter's relationship status (particularly with M)

Norman Osborn's Sins

New Sinister Six Plot 

Chasm/Hallow's Eve Plot 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's all the major story beats that Wells needs to resolve before ending his run. Considering that Tombstone was teased in Web of Spider-Man, and the Chasm stuff seems like it's getting resolved in the next issue maybe, all that's left is this Sinister Six polot and how Norman's sins are going to play into it. My guess for what's going to happen is as follows: 

Norman's sins fully manifest in Norman, prompting the return of the Green Goblin. Exploiting the now hot potato nature of his sins, Green Goblin uses them to re-corrupt Peter. Giving birth to this Spider-Goblin. When Peter was possessed last time, he went on a hitlist of all that wronged him in his life. So, given this time he seems fully transformed by the sins, Spider-Goblin goes on a rampage. Targeting the Sinister Six and everything that's wronged him in his life, including the Green Goblin (which, based on ASM 54's cover, seems like the two goblins are gonna duke it out and the end). Mj, Paul, Randy and the other supporting characters will probably play a big role across these 5 issues. All the while, Tombstone will continue amassing resources for his plan to take out Spider-Man once and for. With issues 55 through 60 being Tombstone's plot and the final arc of the Wells run. Ending with hopefully a final resolution on Peter and MJS relationship and a final showdown between Spider-Man and Tombstone. 

What do you guys think? Am I missing anything? In a weird way, I'm kind of excited to see where this Spider-Goblin storyline goes considering how long it is (an 80 page issue with four following issues). Though it's still so weird that Peter was the goblin being teased all along. Maybe after this, he can better empathize with Chasm since it seems like a similar mirror/storybeat. ",Marvel,0,0.5
