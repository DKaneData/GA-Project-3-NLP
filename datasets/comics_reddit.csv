"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV, and More! [April 22, 2024 - Dead Boys Tell No Tales Edition]","Hey there honorary Justice League members - it‚Äôs a new week which means it‚Äôs time for a new discussion thread!

- Predaplant's pick of the week: [*Detective Comics* #1084](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rmbjtZMUL.jpg)

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week‚Äôs releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too. In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. **Do not post top-level comments**. 

**Keep discussion civil.** Do not harass other users for having a different opinion. Do not use this thread to push your personal one-sided grudges against creators. Reacting to a panel on Twitter is not the same as reading a book.

Wondering, what is the general consensus on Azrael as a character? Is he well-regarded in the fandom? I really liked his introduction with that sword of Azrael storyline, and thought I was going to be a huge fan, but then his midway arc in knightfall was a huge slog for me, and I found myself annoyed by his character.

Not to mention he does the same with Lucifer. Why does this happen, does he actually have a some sort of blessing, talent, mad IQ, or is he just written like that and the writers just nerfs the intelligence of these beings? If it's a written thing, for what purpose is he written like that? Like how superman is written to show hope, justice, the American way, what is Constantine supposed to represent, the wits and resilience of a human being? Can he do the same with all deities or just demons in particular? Because it would be madly insane yet impressive if he can somehow outsmart the big G aka God Himself.",DCcomics,1,0.53
"Let's discuss ""The Long Halloween"" ending, who's actually the Holiday Killer?","Note: lots of spoilers, don't read this post if you haven't read the comic

I just finished reading ""The Long Halloween"" for the second time, and I'm equally puzzled and intrigued by the ending as I was the first time. Everything more or less makes sense until that strange and confusing conclusion. Who is the holiday killer? How many holiday killers are there in total?

One of the theories, and probably the most plausible one, is that we have 2 holiday killers: the first one being Gilda Dent and the second one Alberto Falcone, who continues where Gilda left off. There's no reason to doubt Gilda's confession when she sets fire to Holiday's remains while thinking out loud. So, I believe she actually did commit the murders up until New Year's, wanting to free Harvey from his job and protect the family. This would mean that Gilda killed Johnny Viti, the Irish gang, (although it's debatable how likely it is for one woman to kill a group of mobsters, but in comic logic, I guess it's possible), and Milos, Falcone's bodyguard.

Alberto takes on the role of Holiday after faking his death on New Year's, but that part is somewhat unclear to me. It would take a lot of coincidences for Alberto to pick up where Gilda left off without any agreement or cooperation. But let's chalk up that inconsistency to comic logic as well. 

Throughout the story, Dent's role is the most unclear to me. He claims there are two holiday killers, which is probably the case, but we don't know if he's referring to himself as one of them (as Batman assumes) or to Alberto and his wife. Does Harvey even know that his wife is Holiday? And if we were to include Harvey's killings as part of the ""Holiday killer"" murders, then would we have three holiday killers?

However, I believe Harvey is not the holiday killer; his two murders are solely the result of personal vendettas that happened to coincide on holidays. Gilda still believes Harvey is the second killer, though, while in her logic, Alberto is just a scapegoat taking responsibility for reasons known to him.

The story is quite complicated, and I honestly think the authors got a bit lost in the narrative, making it overly convoluted to the point of creating too many plot holes/leaps, and there isn't a perfectly logical explanation. So, all we're left with is to develop our own theories about what exactly happened and who the killers are. I choose the variant where the killers are Gilda and Alberto, while Harvey only turns evil after becoming Two-Face, i.e., after the accident (although it could be argued that his malice started much earlier, given he knew about his wife's murders) ",DCcomics,48,0.83

Real Lazarus Tournament?,"Who would win if all the best martial artists were brought together? Who would all be there?

Here's my scenario( no killing goes to knock out. No powers)
My 8 (cause it makes even brackets) in no particular order are:
1. Nightwing; I'm a fan boy so I put him first but he deserves to be on this list.
2. Batman; if the guy above is on this list then yah
3. Orphan; duh
4. Lady Shiva; at this point it is a mommy daughter father son play date
5. Deathstroke
6. Richard dragon
7. Connor hawke
8. Black canary
Honorable mentions: bronze tiger, wildcat, karate kid

First round:
1vs8. Dick wins. Black canary is actually pretty easily beaten here. She is keeping up with the fight until dick gets her in a scenario where she would typically use her canary cry. She doesn't but it causes her to hesitate and dick wins

2v7. This one appears to everyone to be a fair fight until batman doesn't take a winning a blow and it becomes clear that he's seeing what Connor can do. After Bruce bears Connor he offers him some advice and training if Connor ever wants it. Connor accepts on the condition he does not have to wear scaly green short shorts

3v6. Idk much about Richard dragon tbh but orphan is goated so she wins.

4v5. Shiva beats deathstroke but deathstroke eggs her on into killing him. Slade is resurrected by the Lazarus pit and sent to the next round as Shiva broke a rule

1v5. Common I'm a nightwing fan boy you know this fight was going to happen. Legitamently the most bloody fight of the tournament. Dick changes his first name to Mark because of how beat up he is after the fight (not actually its an invincible joke). Dick falls many times but always gets back up. At the end Slade asks why and dick Says ""its the reason I fall"" and batman smirks. Slade then forfeits.

2v3. At the start the fight is clearly being won by batman who seems to be getting very angry despite winning. Half way through he stops and calls orphan out for not giving all she has. Batman says she doesn't have to hold back out of fear of hurting him. Orphan lowers her head and then becomes a different animal. This fight is really good with batman relying as much as possible on his strength and constitution, his inner monolgue stating that this strategy is a failing one as he taught her to fight opponents far stronger then him, but that he can't use gadgets or stealth or anything to win this fight. Orphan beats him and afterward walks up to him and let's out a sigh and simply states ""how"" and batman tells her an elaborate way he could have won the fight. Probably using the sand to blind her or something. Orphan then states ""why"" and he says he wanted to fight her as a martial artist. As an equal.

3v1. I am conflicted on this one cause I know how I want to end it but I think it's my fan boy coming out again so I'll give two options.

1. Orphan let's nightwing win because she understands his elevated role in the new dcu and what being the best martial artist in the world would do to help in that role.

2. Nightwing tries to tire orphan out by acrobatically avoiding her, but even exhausted she still manages to win. He admits to being a little let down due to thinking it'd be a better fight. She puts a hand on his chest and says ""good"" and then puts it on her own and says ""better"" and smiles and they have a nice sibling moment to end the series.

Debriefing with the batfamily later has Damian absolutely livid he wasn't invited. Babs and Tim are talking about how martial arts won't mean much with the rate technology is improving. Jason is absolutely roasting dick for losing to a girl after beating the worlds greatest assasin(or in scenario 1 hes roasting him because a girl had to let him win). Steph immediatley implodes at Jason for some unitended sexism. Duke asks Bruce for more martial arts training as he states he thinks out of everyone in the room he'd be the first to lose. He doesn't want to fall behind. ",DCcomics,0,0.3

What to read to understand Crisis on Infinites Earths,"Hi.

I am looking to get back into reading DC comics. I have dabbled throughout the past years reading independent stories (Batman year one, long Halloween, Hush) but was always frustrated with not knowing where to continue. 

I have not read anything for the past 3 years so for all intents and purposes assume I know NOTHING. I am also on a student budget so I cannot read everything, nor do I have the time to do so. 

I have decided I would like to start at Crisis on Infinite Earths (open to suggestions other than this) and would like to know either a few comics I should read to have the needed context or if anyone would like to write the needed context below that would be much appreciated. 

I want to understand the major events in DC continuity (when flash switches, when robin switches, the important events in general) and would like to do so in a condensed way. 

After reading crisis where should I go next? I have heard Perez‚Äôs Wonder Woman is great, year 1 etc. 

I would like to read Geoff Jon‚Äôs Green Lantern and Flashpoint at some point as well. 

I understand this is a broad question but please don‚Äôt suggest ‚Äúread what you like‚Äù I DONT KNOW WHAT I LIKE and would rather understand the most of the DC Universe in as limited amount of time and money as possible. 

Thank you in advance. ",DCcomics,0,0.5

COIE mini-series,"Okay, so I dig the mini-series, especially that the segments use one or two characters as a focal point. A few things don't make sense.  First, I'm having trouble with Batman. He's seemingly the Earth 1 version, yet he didn't take Dick under his scalloped wing, as a result, he appears to have no Bat-family. Then there's the lack of an Earth 1 Wonder Woman, the preeminent female superhero, yet Kara mentions that she is on the satellite when speaking of the E1 Superman and Batman. Black Canary is missing from E1, seemingly never having left E2. Vixen seems to have filled her spot, even in GA's life. Then, there's Amazo and Luthor being the reason the JLA gathered as team. I understand that story had to be modified (a lot) to fit into a relatively easy to follow narrative, but some modifications are so far from the original story that I wish they had changed the name.

Lower the stakes. (a message to DC comic writers and story writers in general),"the existence of superpowered heroes necessitates the existence of superpowered threats in order to produce real stakes. This is the danger in creating strong characters. A strong character needs a strong opponent. they beat said opponent, are proven stronger, and thus an even more powerful opponent is needed for any real threat to be present. This can lead to a lot of mindless power scaling that ultimately becomes meaningless- in the same way that hearing about one tragedy befalling a family often hits harder emotionally than seeing a statistic about hundreds of people being killed. Our brains just can't really comprehend a scale like that. In my opinion, the constant ramping up of stakes cheapens the quality of storytelling. And in itself, the idea that every superhero needs to be ultra-powerful god-adjacent is unnecessary.

Not every hero needs to be extremely powerful, because heroes are allowed to deal with different scales of threats on different levels. Superman is incredibly strong, but he'll never be able to be everywhere, and he won't know how to solve every problem. Heroes can exist that work on a smaller level. (Like the friendly neighborhood spiderman, if he stayed neighborhood level.)

By having heroes that maybe aren't men of steel like Kryptonians, you can have those more personal stories, but they don't *feel* like they don't matter or have low stakes. Sometimes a story about trying to save a pet cat, or to save just one person, can hit a lot harder than one about protecting the globe, depending on the execution. You can still get really gritty and close-to-home with characters fighting for lower stakes. These stories also prop up the bigger ones, because they create anchors in the story for readers to latch onto: A tangible representation of the people these heroes are protecting, beyond just a statistic. It's hard to imagine the entire earth exploding, but knowing that the cat that a lower-level hero went through all that effort to save is going to go away? that's a lot more impactful than a number. 

further, I think that lower-level heroes are really empowering. Because even though said character might not be superman, they're still helping people, no matter how small that effort is, which in itself is heroic. 

And weaker characters can be more than just a one-off mention to convey a message about community or something. You can place focus on lower-level threats, and still keep an audience engaged, as long as the story is compelling.

anyways, this is a plea for writers not to think they have to make every hero a master of their craft, and every villain world threatening. You're allowed to write weaker characters. It can highlight the strength of your powerful characters, and the strength of the relatively weaker ones in their own special ways. You to tell a lot of interesting, more grounded stories. There's a place for world-ending threats in comic book fiction. There's also a place for street-level threats.

Also how do you think the Batfamily would interact with other major characters like the students in class 1A, Pro Hero's, and villains like the members of the LOV. Also in this fic Batman has a personality similar to the one he had in the animated series that being cold but Compassionate. As for the Batman villains that will be playing major roles they are going to broken up into groups A, B, and C for convineance. Group A which is lead by Joker and has Punchline, Scarecrow and Maybe Killer Moth working for him joins up with the LOV. Group B which is lead by Penguin and has Riddler and Killer Croc working for him joins up with Redestro's group, and finally group C which is lead by Two-Face and has Bane and Clayface working for him joins up with Oberhaul and his Yakuza.

Absolute Absolution,"So a few days ago in one thread talking about the new Absolute Comics launch I saw a few posts joking around how weird is going to be when those titles get Absolute editions and we ended up with stuff like ""Absolute Absolute Batman""

But also a very funny one was what if the imprint do at some point an event a la Ultimatum called ""Absolution"" and we get ""Absolute Absolution"". That was very funny.

Today I was reading the description for Al Ewing's Roxxon presents Thor, an issue about a super capitalist version of Thor created by evil corporation Roxxon and there Ewing uses as a joke a fake event called ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTION

The Rumors of Absolute DC,"Its still very recent that the rumors started over this thing. Frankly, I'm open to it; TBH, DC is a very rebooting company, so if you didn't expect this, to quote the James Franco meme: first time, huh? However, this is not seen as a reboot at all, yet feels like it is, or separate.

To clear it up, this is what is know from Bleeding Cool: Absolute DC aka DC All-In will be very close to the hands off/carte blance approach the old All Star line was supposed to have, but to the larger DCU, led by Scott Snyder. So this is not like the New 52, or DC Rebirth, but like Ultimate Marvel; BUT, it won't be separated from the main line, but published in conjunction instead, aiming for a spotlight on DC's entire lineup with this initiative. And above all, still in canon. If true, it would be an attempt to do New 52 right, and be a more ""holistic"" approach with DC Rebirth. And of course, if it is true, we'll hear about it at SDCC 2024.

Because its a rumor and a brand new at that, I wanted to ask two questions for everyone here. 

A) What are people's thoughts on this idea, if true?

New crisis on infinite earths movies is better than the source material ,"Part 1 and part 2 are out now. I‚Äôll start by saying I think part 2 was pretty mediocre, but I thought part 1 was immaculate. More comparisons with the comic when I talk about part 2. 

Lex and Amazo

Part 1 really impressed me. My favorite aspect was how threatening Lex was made out to be. Using parasite and amazo tech to make a super suit made it narratively satisfying when he used it to stand up to the entire justice league. Too often is lex made out to be weak so this depiction of power really resonated with me. Additionally, this is easily my favorite depiction of Amazo. Lex corrupting his programming to make him a villain made Amazo and Ivo a bit more more nuanced than a strong robot and evil scientist. I liked how Ivo was the one who stopped him in the end by getting him to expel his energy.

Clark and Bruce

Another thing I liked about part 1 was the justice league origin. I loved the dynamic between Bruce and Clark. Bruce trusts Clark to keep everything a secret, then gets his identity ousted by Clark needing help. As a big Batman fan, dragging Bruce into a teamwork dynamic was very in character in my opinion. I also liked how the justice league wasn‚Äôt formed by some world threatening event. Felt a bit more natural to have it happen due to Clark being a bit clumsy with the secrets.

Diana and Barry

I always thought wonder woman was most tied to WW2 so I like that she is able to have that romance with Steve Trevor while also being apart of the modern world. I‚Äôm not the biggest multiverse guy but I enjoyed that being how Wonder woman comes to the team. Love her accent and built aesthic too. Then this is probably my favorite depiction of the flash. Keep in mind I only read Batman. But he was funny and charismatic while not being a clown. His slightly goofy cool guy personality was very well done to me. 

Here‚Äôs where I talk more part 2 and comics
Personally I consider the crisis on infinite earths comic to be more history than a great standard of writing. The recruitment of all the heroes takes too many pages and the story looses momentum by focusing on too many realities that just aren‚Äôt that interesting. I like how part 2 seemingly relegates all the shadow demons to one film because they get much overstay their welcome in the comics. Like I said earlier, part 2 isn't a good film but I think it depicts the whole tower defense arc of the comics better.

I also think the films are much better at fleshing out the characters of the monitor, harbinger, psycho pirate, and Pariah. They feel like plot devices in the comic and less so characters with nuance. This is one of the biggest pros of the films since the plot essentially revolves around them.

Also the crime syndicate was dope and I have no issue with Lex's kid being removed. Just made the comic more convoluted anyways

Hot take on Identity Crisis and what happened to Doctor Light (spoilers for the comic below),"So we all know Doctor Light was made into a rapist and had to be lobotomized by the JLA. 

My basic hot take/question is; 

Am I seriously the only person who struggles to see how ""lobotomizing the guy"" is somehow worse than letting him go on to rape Sue again. I mean come on what would you have done, would you have just sat by and let it happen. 

Anyway I already know that this is the unpopular opinion on this subreddit and this post will be downvoted to oblivion but surely there is at least one person who agree it was the better option. A woman was raped and I'm 70% sure he not only was gonna do it again he also threatened to do it to the Flash's wife after he found out who she was. 

The basic premise of the story is how the JLA  betrayed Batman but maybe because I'm not as crazy about Batman as I was maybe 10 years ago but I find it so hypocritical how he has the nerve to talk about being betrayed when bro has a hit list on all his friends and is spying on them 24/7 with brother eye. I mean sit there and actually think about that. One of your friends having a hit list on you and all your fellow friends and everything you do he is just spying on you. 

The rest of the Jla are always written to forgive Batman no matter what he does and he is never in the wrong or the story will always bend over backwards to justify whatever he does (pretty sure Identity Crisis was written just to justify tower of Babel) but when it's the other way around they have to seek his forgiveness and all admit how wrong they were. It really just makes Batman unlikable for me and makes me wish he'd just stick to Gotham.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I sidetracked myself this post was about Doctor Light and my point is pretty straightforward. Yeah if there was a better option then lobotomizing a man no matter how evil is pretty fucked up but there was no better option (except killing the guy) and so given the context of the situation I don't think the rest of the JLA have anything to feel sorry for. It's like feeling sorry that you locked up a criminal because you are no better than a kidnapper...obviously you are. You are doing it for the greater good and the 2 scenarios are not the same. So yeah that's my post, I'll read all your comments if anyone bothers to respond",DCcomics,6,0.57

[Discussion] Whats your opinionated pinpoint of retrospective on New 52 Wonder Woman that you find the least appealing?,"
Here‚Äôs my least favourite thing on new 52 Wonder Woman-the Major disappointment of the New 52 version of Wonder Woman was clearly her clich√© romance with Clark. Diana, who should embody strength and empowerment, was reduced to nothing more than Clark's trophy. It's ridiculous and ludicrous that they thought a tired, clich√© relationship would suit Clark's character. Worse yet, whenever they were together, Diana was clearly portrayed as a flipping weakling and submissive. Looks like the New 52 writers clearly dropped the flippin‚Äô ball on understanding Wonder Woman's character.

Part 2 to my post. ,"(Sorry in advanced if I‚Äôm getting annoying with all these questions) 

I previously posted like 2 days ago. Asking for a list of EVERYTHING in New 52 &amp; how to read it. 

Based on the comments, I wanna clarify/change some things. 

People said that reading EVERYTHING isn‚Äôt recommended because apparently most of it is boring/bad. 

So ig I‚Äôll just stick to DC characters I like. My top 5 ig would be (it‚Äôs wierd, Ik) but Batman, Nightwing, The Flash, Green Arrow, &amp; Beast Boy/Teen Titans. So ig my new questions are‚Ä¶  

1. Since I‚Äôve already started collecting a lot of New 52 TPB‚Äôs from those characters, so the completionist in me wants to finish those, &amp; I do plan on getting the Rebirth runs of those characters. 

But is there a specific list of like everything batfamily related? Cause the lists that I‚Äôve seen are detailed, but are missing some runs. Like I don‚Äôt see Batman Eternal or Batman &amp; Robin Eternal. &amp; those are just the ones I know about. But what other runs am I missing that‚Äôs also missing on the lists yk? &amp; I‚Äôm also asking about other runs that include those characters or are universe events that affect everyone (like I think Future‚Äôs End) 

2. What are some stories or runs that are good to read that focuses on those characters, sure I‚Äôd like the recommendations like Hush, Long Halloween, etc. but doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù stuff. &amp; it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be one book stories. I don‚Äôt mind collecting runs that are like 6+ TPB‚Äôs. 

3. I‚Äôm confused on Rebirth. Ik that flashpoint basically reset DC into the New 52, but after fans not liking the new 52, they re-reset the continuity with Rebirth. 

So my question is, is rebirth a continuation of whatever stories were being told before DC did Flashpoint? Or is it a FULL reset where I could start reading rebirth from the beginning without having to read older pre-flashpoint runs? &amp; also, what is Rebirth‚Äôs version of Flashpoint? Like what storyline caused the reset in-universe. 

&amp; lastly. I‚Äôve heard different explanations of Rebirh. Half say it‚Äôs a reboot of New 52, but it‚Äôs also a continuation, like to get the FULL FULL story, read both New 52 &amp; Rebirth, like those characters still remember they‚Äôre New 52 versions, but went through changes for Rebirth. But the other half say Rebirth has NOTHING to do with New 52. It just kills off New 52 completely &amp; starts from scratch. Which is it? ",DCcomics,0,0.3

I'm wanting to explore more nightwing and future teen titans runs but I want to know what major events I would be missing if I didn't finish this whole series. For example I read the first few issues of the 1996 nightwing by Chuck Dixon and Dick mentions something about his last relationship ending in a funeral.

Real Lazarus Tournament?,"Who would win if all the best martial artists were brought together? Who would all be there?

Here's my scenario( no killing goes to knock out. No powers)
My 8 (cause it makes even brackets) in no particular order are:
1. Nightwing; I'm a fan boy so I put him first but he deserves to be on this list.
2. Batman; if the guy above is on this list then yah
3. Orphan; duh
4. Lady Shiva; at this point it is a mommy daughter father son play date
5. Deathstroke
6. Richard dragon
7. Connor hawke
8. Black canary
Honorable mentions: bronze tiger, wildcat, karate kid

First round:
1vs8. Dick wins. Black canary is actually pretty easily beaten here. She is keeping up with the fight until dick gets her in a scenario where she would typically use her canary cry. She doesn't but it causes her to hesitate and dick wins

2v7. This one appears to everyone to be a fair fight until batman doesn't take a winning a blow and it becomes clear that he's seeing what Connor can do. After Bruce bears Connor he offers him some advice and training if Connor ever wants it. Connor accepts on the condition he does not have to wear scaly green short shorts

3v6. Idk much about Richard dragon tbh but orphan is goated so she wins.

4v5. Shiva beats deathstroke but deathstroke eggs her on into killing him. Slade is resurrected by the Lazarus pit and sent to the next round as Shiva broke a rule

1v5. Common I'm a nightwing fan boy you know this fight was going to happen. Legitamently the most bloody fight of the tournament. Dick changes his first name to Mark because of how beat up he is after the fight (not actually its an invincible joke). Dick falls many times but always gets back up. At the end Slade asks why and dick Says ""its the reason I fall"" and batman smirks. Slade then forfeits.

2v3. At the start the fight is clearly being won by batman who seems to be getting very angry despite winning. Half way through he stops and calls orphan out for not giving all she has. Batman says she doesn't have to hold back out of fear of hurting him. Orphan lowers her head and then becomes a different animal. This fight is really good with batman relying as much as possible on his strength and constitution, his inner monolgue stating that this strategy is a failing one as he taught her to fight opponents far stronger then him, but that he can't use gadgets or stealth or anything to win this fight. Orphan beats him and afterward walks up to him and let's out a sigh and simply states ""how"" and batman tells her an elaborate way he could have won the fight. Probably using the sand to blind her or something. Orphan then states ""why"" and he says he wanted to fight her as a martial artist. As an equal.

3v1. I am conflicted on this one cause I know how I want to end it but I think it's my fan boy coming out again so I'll give two options.

1. Orphan let's nightwing win because she understands his elevated role in the new dcu and what being the best martial artist in the world would do to help in that role.

2. Nightwing tries to tire orphan out by acrobatically avoiding her, but even exhausted she still manages to win. He admits to being a little let down due to thinking it'd be a better fight. She puts a hand on his chest and says ""good"" and then puts it on her own and says ""better"" and smiles and they have a nice sibling moment to end the series.

Debriefing with the batfamily later has Damian absolutely livid he wasn't invited. Babs and Tim are talking about how martial arts won't mean much with the rate technology is improving. Jason is absolutely roasting dick for losing to a girl after beating the worlds greatest assasin(or in scenario 1 hes roasting him because a girl had to let him win). Steph immediatley implodes at Jason for some unitended sexism. Duke asks Bruce for more martial arts training as he states he thinks out of everyone in the room he'd be the first to lose. He doesn't want to fall behind. ",DCcomics,0,0.42

What to read to understand Crisis on Infinites Earths,"Hi.

I am looking to get back into reading DC comics. I have dabbled throughout the past years reading independent stories (Batman year one, long Halloween, Hush) but was always frustrated with not knowing where to continue. 

I have not read anything for the past 3 years so for all intents and purposes assume I know NOTHING. I am also on a student budget so I cannot read everything, nor do I have the time to do so. 

I have decided I would like to start at Crisis on Infinite Earths (open to suggestions other than this) and would like to know either a few comics I should read to have the needed context or if anyone would like to write the needed context below that would be much appreciated. 

I want to understand the major events in DC continuity (when flash switches, when robin switches, the important events in general) and would like to do so in a condensed way. 

After reading crisis where should I go next? I have heard Perez‚Äôs Wonder Woman is great, year 1 etc. 

I would like to read Geoff Jon‚Äôs Green Lantern and Flashpoint at some point as well. 

I understand this is a broad question but please don‚Äôt suggest ‚Äúread what you like‚Äù I DONT KNOW WHAT I LIKE and would rather understand the most of the DC Universe in as limited amount of time and money as possible.

He's seemingly the Earth 1 version, yet he didn't take Dick under his scalloped wing, as a result, he appears to have no Bat-family. Then there's the lack of an Earth 1 Wonder Woman, the preeminent female superhero, yet Kara mentions that she is on the satellite when speaking of the E1 Superman and Batman. Black Canary is missing from E1, seemingly never having left E2. Vixen seems to have filled her spot, even in GA's life. Then, there's Amazo and Luthor being the reason the JLA gathered as team. I understand that story had to be modified (a lot) to fit into a relatively easy to follow narrative, but some modifications are so far from the original story that I wish they had changed the name. Is it supposed to be a roll-up of all the Crises?",DCcomics,1,0.67

Lower the stakes. (a message to DC comic writers and story writers in general),"the existence of superpowered heroes necessitates the existence of superpowered threats in order to produce real stakes. This is the danger in creating strong characters. A strong character needs a strong opponent. they beat said opponent, are proven stronger, and thus an even more powerful opponent is needed for any real threat to be present. This can lead to a lot of mindless power scaling that ultimately becomes meaningless- in the same way that hearing about one tragedy befalling a family often hits harder emotionally than seeing a statistic about hundreds of people being killed. Our brains just can't really comprehend a scale like that. In my opinion, the constant ramping up of stakes cheapens the quality of storytelling. And in itself, the idea that every superhero needs to be ultra-powerful god-adjacent is unnecessary.

Not every hero needs to be extremely powerful, because heroes are allowed to deal with different scales of threats on different levels. Superman is incredibly strong, but he'll never be able to be everywhere, and he won't know how to solve every problem. Heroes can exist that work on a smaller level. (Like the friendly neighborhood spiderman, if he stayed neighborhood level.)

By having heroes that maybe aren't men of steel like Kryptonians, you can have those more personal stories, but they don't *feel* like they don't matter or have low stakes. Sometimes a story about trying to save a pet cat, or to save just one person, can hit a lot harder than one about protecting the globe, depending on the execution. You can still get really gritty and close-to-home with characters fighting for lower stakes. These stories also prop up the bigger ones, because they create anchors in the story for readers to latch onto: A tangible representation of the people these heroes are protecting, beyond just a statistic. It's hard to imagine the entire earth exploding, but knowing that the cat that a lower-level hero went through all that effort to save is going to go away? that's a lot more impactful than a number. 

further, I think that lower-level heroes are really empowering. Because even though said character might not be superman, they're still helping people, no matter how small that effort is, which in itself is heroic. 

And weaker characters can be more than just a one-off mention to convey a message about community or something. You can place focus on lower-level threats, and still keep an audience engaged, as long as the story is compelling.

anyways, this is a plea for writers not to think they have to make every hero a master of their craft, and every villain world threatening. You're allowed to write weaker characters. It can highlight the strength of your powerful characters, and the strength of the relatively weaker ones in their own special ways. You to tell a lot of interesting, more grounded stories. There's a place for world-ending threats in comic book fiction. There's also a place for street-level threats.

I‚Äôm writing a fan fic where the Batfamily get Isekai‚Äôd into the MHA(My Hero Academia) universe and i need some suggestions  ,"In my fic Damian is a part of Class 1A however I'm having a little dilemma you see I don't know if I should have the rest of the Batfamily be vigilantes that Izuku, All Might, and Nezu all know about but chose not to do anything about or have Nezu and All Might use their connections to get the Batfamily hero licenses. Also how do you think the Batfamily would interact with other major characters like the students in class 1A, Pro Hero's, and villains like the members of the LOV. Also in this fic Batman has a personality similar to the one he had in the animated series that being cold but Compassionate. As for the Batman villains that will be playing major roles they are going to broken up into groups A, B, and C for convineance. Group A which is lead by Joker and has Punchline, Scarecrow and Maybe Killer Moth working for him joins up with the LOV. Group B which is lead by Penguin and has Riddler and Killer Croc working for him joins up with Redestro's group, and finally group C which is lead by Two-Face and has Bane and Clayface working for him joins up with Oberhaul and his Yakuza. How do you think these Batman villains should interact with characters like the LOV, Class 1A, and the Pro Hero's.

Also in my fic the Batfamily consists of Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin/Damian Wayne, and Harley Quinn

Also Alfred, Raven, and Poison Ivy are left behind in the DC universe and will have a subplot of trying to find out what happened to the Batfamily

Absolute Absolution,"So a few days ago in one thread talking about the new Absolute Comics launch I saw a few posts joking around how weird is going to be when those titles get Absolute editions and we ended up with stuff like ""Absolute Absolute Batman""

But also a very funny one was what if the imprint do at some point an event a la Ultimatum called ""Absolution"" and we get ""Absolute Absolution"". That was very funny.

Today I was reading the description for Al Ewing's Roxxon presents Thor, an issue about a super capitalist version of Thor created by evil corporation Roxxon and there Ewing uses as a joke a fake event called ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTION

The Rumors of Absolute DC,"Its still very recent that the rumors started over this thing. Frankly, I'm open to it; TBH, DC is a very rebooting company, so if you didn't expect this, to quote the James Franco meme: first time, huh? However, this is not seen as a reboot at all, yet feels like it is, or separate.

To clear it up, this is what is know from Bleeding Cool: Absolute DC aka DC All-In will be very close to the hands off/carte blance approach the old All Star line was supposed to have, but to the larger DCU, led by Scott Snyder. So this is not like the New 52, or DC Rebirth, but like Ultimate Marvel; BUT, it won't be separated from the main line, but published in conjunction instead, aiming for a spotlight on DC's entire lineup with this initiative. And above all, still in canon. If true, it would be an attempt to do New 52 right, and be a more ""holistic"" approach with DC Rebirth. And of course, if it is true, we'll hear about it at SDCC 2024.

Because its a rumor and a brand new at that, I wanted to ask two questions for everyone here. 

A) What are people's thoughts on this idea, if true?

New crisis on infinite earths movies is better than the source material ,"Part 1 and part 2 are out now. I‚Äôll start by saying I think part 2 was pretty mediocre, but I thought part 1 was immaculate. More comparisons with the comic when I talk about part 2. 

Lex and Amazo

Part 1 really impressed me. My favorite aspect was how threatening Lex was made out to be. Using parasite and amazo tech to make a super suit made it narratively satisfying when he used it to stand up to the entire justice league. Too often is lex made out to be weak so this depiction of power really resonated with me. Additionally, this is easily my favorite depiction of Amazo. Lex corrupting his programming to make him a villain made Amazo and Ivo a bit more more nuanced than a strong robot and evil scientist. I liked how Ivo was the one who stopped him in the end by getting him to expel his energy.

Clark and Bruce

Another thing I liked about part 1 was the justice league origin. I loved the dynamic between Bruce and Clark. Bruce trusts Clark to keep everything a secret, then gets his identity ousted by Clark needing help. As a big Batman fan, dragging Bruce into a teamwork dynamic was very in character in my opinion. I also liked how the justice league wasn‚Äôt formed by some world threatening event. Felt a bit more natural to have it happen due to Clark being a bit clumsy with the secrets.

Diana and Barry

I always thought wonder woman was most tied to WW2 so I like that she is able to have that romance with Steve Trevor while also being apart of the modern world. I‚Äôm not the biggest multiverse guy but I enjoyed that being how Wonder woman comes to the team. Love her accent and built aesthic too. Then this is probably my favorite depiction of the flash. Keep in mind I only read Batman. But he was funny and charismatic while not being a clown. His slightly goofy cool guy personality was very well done to me. 

Here‚Äôs where I talk more part 2 and comics
Personally I consider the crisis on infinite earths comic to be more history than a great standard of writing. The recruitment of all the heroes takes too many pages and the story looses momentum by focusing on too many realities that just aren‚Äôt that interesting. I like how part 2 seemingly relegates all the shadow demons to one film because they get much overstay their welcome in the comics. Like I said earlier, part 2 isn't a good film but I think it depicts the whole tower defense arc of the comics better.

I also think the films are much better at fleshing out the characters of the monitor, harbinger, psycho pirate, and Pariah. They feel like plot devices in the comic and less so characters with nuance. This is one of the biggest pros of the films since the plot essentially revolves around them.

Also the crime syndicate was dope and I have no issue with Lex's kid being removed. Just made the comic more convoluted anyways

Hot take on Identity Crisis and what happened to Doctor Light (spoilers for the comic below),"So we all know Doctor Light was made into a rapist and had to be lobotomized by the JLA. 

My basic hot take/question is; 

Am I seriously the only person who struggles to see how ""lobotomizing the guy"" is somehow worse than letting him go on to rape Sue again. I mean come on what would you have done, would you have just sat by and let it happen. 

Anyway I already know that this is the unpopular opinion on this subreddit and this post will be downvoted to oblivion but surely there is at least one person who agree it was the better option. A woman was raped and I'm 70% sure he not only was gonna do it again he also threatened to do it to the Flash's wife after he found out who she was. 

The basic premise of the story is how the JLA  betrayed Batman but maybe because I'm not as crazy about Batman as I was maybe 10 years ago but I find it so hypocritical how he has the nerve to talk about being betrayed when bro has a hit list on all his friends and is spying on them 24/7 with brother eye. I mean sit there and actually think about that. One of your friends having a hit list on you and all your fellow friends and everything you do he is just spying on you. 

The rest of the Jla are always written to forgive Batman no matter what he does and he is never in the wrong or the story will always bend over backwards to justify whatever he does (pretty sure Identity Crisis was written just to justify tower of Babel) but when it's the other way around they have to seek his forgiveness and all admit how wrong they were. It really just makes Batman unlikable for me and makes me wish he'd just stick to Gotham.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I sidetracked myself this post was about Doctor Light and my point is pretty straightforward. Yeah if there was a better option then lobotomizing a man no matter how evil is pretty fucked up but there was no better option (except killing the guy) and so given the context of the situation I don't think the rest of the JLA have anything to feel sorry for. It's like feeling sorry that you locked up a criminal because you are no better than a kidnapper...obviously you are. You are doing it for the greater good and the 2 scenarios are not the same. So yeah that's my post, I'll read all your comments if anyone bothers to respond",DCcomics,4,0.55

[Discussion] Whats your opinionated pinpoint of retrospective on New 52 Wonder Woman that you find the least appealing?,"
Here‚Äôs my least favourite thing on new 52 Wonder Woman-the Major disappointment of the New 52 version of Wonder Woman was clearly her clich√© romance with Clark. Diana, who should embody strength and empowerment, was reduced to nothing more than Clark's trophy. It's ridiculous and ludicrous that they thought a tired, clich√© relationship would suit Clark's character. Worse yet, whenever they were together, Diana was clearly portrayed as a flipping weakling and submissive. Looks like the New 52 writers clearly dropped the flippin‚Äô ball on understanding Wonder Woman's character.

Part 2 to my post. ,"(Sorry in advanced if I‚Äôm getting annoying with all these questions) 

I previously posted like 2 days ago. Asking for a list of EVERYTHING in New 52 &amp; how to read it. 

Based on the comments, I wanna clarify/change some things. 

People said that reading EVERYTHING isn‚Äôt recommended because apparently most of it is boring/bad. 

So ig I‚Äôll just stick to DC characters I like. My top 5 ig would be (it‚Äôs wierd, Ik) but Batman, Nightwing, The Flash, Green Arrow, &amp; Beast Boy/Teen Titans. So ig my new questions are‚Ä¶  

1. Since I‚Äôve already started collecting a lot of New 52 TPB‚Äôs from those characters, so the completionist in me wants to finish those, &amp; I do plan on getting the Rebirth runs of those characters. 

But is there a specific list of like everything batfamily related? Cause the lists that I‚Äôve seen are detailed, but are missing some runs. Like I don‚Äôt see Batman Eternal or Batman &amp; Robin Eternal. &amp; those are just the ones I know about. But what other runs am I missing that‚Äôs also missing on the lists yk? &amp; I‚Äôm also asking about other runs that include those characters or are universe events that affect everyone (like I think Future‚Äôs End) 

2. What are some stories or runs that are good to read that focuses on those characters, sure I‚Äôd like the recommendations like Hush, Long Halloween, etc. but doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù stuff. &amp; it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be one book stories. I don‚Äôt mind collecting runs that are like 6+ TPB‚Äôs. 

3. I‚Äôm confused on Rebirth. Ik that flashpoint basically reset DC into the New 52, but after fans not liking the new 52, they re-reset the continuity with Rebirth. 

So my question is, is rebirth a continuation of whatever stories were being told before DC did Flashpoint? Or is it a FULL reset where I could start reading rebirth from the beginning without having to read older pre-flashpoint runs? &amp; also, what is Rebirth‚Äôs version of Flashpoint? Like what storyline caused the reset in-universe. 

&amp; lastly. I‚Äôve heard different explanations of Rebirh. Half say it‚Äôs a reboot of New 52, but it‚Äôs also a continuation, like to get the FULL FULL story, read both New 52 &amp; Rebirth, like those characters still remember they‚Äôre New 52 versions, but went through changes for Rebirth. But the other half say Rebirth has NOTHING to do with New 52. It just kills off New 52 completely &amp; starts from scratch. Which is it? ",DCcomics,0,0.27

The trade for the Gotham War comes out closer to July and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd be better off to wait and read altogether when it comes out to make sense of the overall run; or to just skip it completely if it‚Äôs not crucial to the story (and apparently bad anyway?)",DCcomics,5,0.7

I was out of comics for some time and I thought that it is time to come back.

So I want to focus on Batman main title, Detective Comics, and bigger events (Heroes in Crisis, Doomsday clock, Death Metal?). But when to read them? I want to catch up until current state.

"Screw your favorite run, what‚Äôs your most hated run (or miniseries) on a character you really like","I‚Äôll start off with two. 

1. Chuck Austen‚Äôs Superman man. Want a Superman run written by a guy who really DOESN‚ÄôT like Superman? Not a doesn‚Äôt get or wants to change Superman for different times, I mean full on does not like him? You got Chuck‚Äôs run. Where he battles his arch enemy, Repo Man, The Kingdom Gog, and his own wife in a battle for truth, Justice, and really being angry and mean at everyone. Superman is very downright unpleasant this run, and it‚Äôs actually really funny how much of a jerk he is. How LAME his villains are, from a Doomsday who is more like Lenny from Mice and Men to the invincible unstoppable omnipotent Repo Man! This is a run I have plenty of fun laughing at, but actually reading it is a painful chore. 

2. Vendetti Flash. I like Vendetti, but man did not get how to write the Flash. Everything is just wild and seems to be just throwing stuff at the wall, a Reverse Flash who is near nothing like Eobard and nothing like Hunter, a police captain who now hates the Flash for the crime of BEING REALLY FAST, and a random Riddler arc slammed into it. Nothing works in the run, from Wally‚Äôs character arc to anything Iris did to Henry Allen suddenly breaking out of jail to kill some guy who he apparently hated. It‚Äôs far more enjoyable than Austen‚Äôs run and while not as bad, is rather just incompetent.

[Discussion] Just finished reading Benjamin Percy's run on Green Arrow," Been meaning to check out this run for a while now and I finally did. 

Overall, I'd say it was good, with a stretch of it (volume 4 and 5) being legit great. I think Percy gets the essence of the character, which is always essential imo. There is nothing groundbreaking in his run but its generally solid. I preferred the art when it is handled by Otto Schmidt, but the other artists did a good job too. I'll always appreciate ""fighting the bigget man"" storylines, so it was nice seeing Ollie's rebirth over the course of the run.

Unfortunately I thought the last volume was super rushed, with major pacing issues and soap opera-esque plot twists and character beats that kinda soured what came before.

Personally, I don't mind this decision. It allows for more creative expressions between each property, allowing the filmmakers of both projects to not worry about continuity between films and whatnot. I mean, if they were in the same universe, that would be Batman would fight a very old Joker, seeing as how he was already an adult in his movie, with Bruce still a child. You'd be hard pressed to make a compelling Batman vs Joker story with that premise (maybe an interesting comedy perhaps).

Earth 3 Counterpart Suggestions?,"For those of you who don't know, Earth 3 is a universe where heroes are villains, and vice versa. It's ruled by the Crime Syndicate, with Ultraman being evil superman, Owlman being evil Batman. Do any of you all have ideas for these alternate counterparts for characters?  


I'll post two of my ideas below.  


Bioluminescence is the alternate version of Black Manta that is a sort of ""champion of two worlds"". David Hyde was born as a child of two worlds, to two humans on the surface that quickly became enamored with Atlantis. I see Bioluminescence as a sort of freedom fighter against the reign of Sea King, and filling the same ""hero of both worlds"". He's almost a comedically good person, having a strong code against killing, and pretty much dedicating his life to try and redeem Sea King into a good king and leader for his people, while helping for small groups of Atlanteans that live against his rule.  


The Gull is the alternate version of the Penguin that was a formerly wealthy. Oswald Cobblepot was a  bleeding heart millionaire that ran afoul with corrupt billionaire Bruce Wayne, who managed to cheat him out of most of hi, forcing him to go underground. He rose up as the Gull- an underground psuedo mob boss that has become something of a hero for the city's underprivileged. He operates through informants of the city's lowest- vagrants and the homeless, those who Owlman nor the corrupt GCPD pay much attention to, gathering information to hopefully drive his fascistic reign to an end.

Does anyone know which comic this is?,"I've been trying to find which comic this is but with no luck.

The basic plot from what I can remember: Bruce was hallucinating Jason Todd and Tim Drake as Robin was driving next to the batmobile (or was the one driving the batmobile). Tim was wearing goggles. Then they get to the batcave and fight? Alfred was mentioned or might've shown up. 

It was made between 1990s - late 2000s. It was also an issue of either Detective Comics or Batman 1940.

[Discussion] The ‚ÄúEarth Day Collection‚Äù in DCUI app unintentionally creates a fun new environmental super team,"DC Universe Infinite has a collection of comics and character spotlights themed around Earth Day, and I thought the characters listed would actually make a cool offbeat, environmentally-conscious team book. Obviously, there‚Äôs some redundancy in powers, but the interpersonal dynamics would be very fun. Maybe this is a team that doesn‚Äôt mind breaking international law if it means securing victory on behalf of Mother Earth, which occasionally puts them at odds with the main Justice League.

Anyway, I would totally give a mini or ongoing featuring ‚ÄúJustice League Earth‚Äù or whatever they‚Äôd call it a fair shot. Are there any other characters you could see adding or swapping in?

Starro the Conqueror (modern take),"So with the advent of a licensed table-top roleplaying game (TTRPG) from the ""other publisher"", I've taken it upon myself to make custom DC characters playable within it.  I've a question about Starro the Conqueror: is his modern concept still the giant alien starfish that continues to grow in size with the more beings he controls?  I saw some indications of a humanoid-looking Starro and was wondering if this is the modern-day Starro, a sort of ""avatar"" of Starro, etc.  This thread has been quick to response before and I really appreciate it!

Incidentally, is anyone familiar with the aforementioned TTRPG from the big ""M""?  And if so, are you interested in seeing any of my DC builds for it?  I've made a bunch on Demiplane and more in the works, but it helps if you have the aforementioned game and some familiarity with it, as the stat blocks are a little unconventional from previous superhero RPGs.

Thanks again in advance, and please don't hate me!!  I want to represent DC well as a valuable resource for those interested!",DCcomics,0,0.5

Should Barry Allen be older or younger?,"So I have been working on a big DC Universe fancast for several years now at this point, but I started wondering this question recently. How old should Barry Allen be?

I should note I had set this fancast universe to have started in 2013, just to work with some actors at certain ages. I had Dylan O'Brien locked in for a while now, but recently other castings I started doing for Nightwing and such have made me start wondering about other casting ideas. 

Anyways the main point is that it got me thinking about what Barry's accepted age range should be? Either in his early to mid 20s, or around is early to mid 30s. Because I think the two recent live action iterations have contributed to this confusion. Grant Gustin was 23 when he first started playing Barry Allen, and Ezra Miller was 22. As well, other Barry's have been depicted as younger recently as well, like Kill the Justice League Barry who says he is youngest member and acts like it.

But then there has been other depictions where he is shown as older. Like John Wesley Shipp was 35 when he first played Barry. As well several other versions from cartoons and games is shown as older at least, like Young Justice, the Tomorrowverse, Batman The Brave and the Bold and Injustice.

So I've become a little confused about this then, especially since age in comics is weird. If you add Wally into the mix when he becomes Flash, then Barry should be older, but then lately they show him as younger. 

I don't know. I was wondering if anyone had a answer to this? Like do the comics point to him being a definitive age range among the League? Or does it possibly not matter, he can be either based on your preference, considering all these different depictions.",DCcomics,1,0.54

So what about Absolute Power was ‚Äú30 years in the making‚Äù exactly?,"Now that we have full details about this summer‚Äôs event Absolute Power, we can safely say that the initial teaser/marketing was a total lie.

People speculated that the event was a sequel to Zero Year or that it had something to do with Parallax but it has nothing to do with anything that took place 30 years ago.

Also it was stated that Mark Waid was gonna be writing all ‚Äú25 issues‚Äù of the event, which we know isn‚Äôt true. He is only writing the main series.

Is DC this desperate for sales that they are relying on lies to sell books to the fans or did they think we‚Äôd just forget about these lies after they generated enough hype around it?",DCcomics,97,0.82

Guys need opinions on a decision related to comics ,"So as I have mentioned before I'm a old comics fan I have read both marvel and DC even some image and valiant. I used to read comics a lot during my teenage years, years ago but I stopped and been reading only manga for a while but lately I have been getting the feeling to return to comics which I kinda did since last week I have been reading Superman and action comics 90s since I didn't get to read them years ago I've only read Superman 2000s, new 52 and rebirth . 

And I still enjoy comics so I'm confused whether to fully return to comics or stay sticking only to manga like I have been since years now since doing both will overwhelming I still got a lot manga on my reading list I plan to read if I add also comics I'll be overwhelmed especially for DC . As for marvel I have already read nearly every marvel character their 90s, 2000s, 2010s comics I only got newerer current marvel comics to read . DC I have read a lot of it too in the past but not everything there's still some older DC titles I didn't read besides the newer current titles .

So if anyone wants to give their opinion what to choose whether manga or comics ? ",DCcomics,0,0.31

[Discussion] Is DC using a cover artist that is using AI?,"This artist, Leirix ([who has an instagram that shows her making art pre-AI, as well as traditional art pieces](https://instagram.com/leirixart)), has done a lot of variant covers for DC (and Marvel), but to me these cover arts all kind of scream AI. Take a look at Wonder Woman #5:

[Notice Wonder Woman's hand, as well as the thumb on the peace sign. The mouths being drawn that way also seems very common in recent stable diffusion AI pieces.](https://preview.redd.it/pjlxfca81xvc1.jpg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b825ca8aa9cb22d1e5eca5e4772a4b78bc123697)

Flash #8 has this art:

[Look at the hands of Irey West on her waist, the line art of both characters also seems extremely inconsistent with normal digital artwork, like on the back of Jessie's leg.](https://preview.redd.it/e8a08da81xvc1.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=772d3e5028a45047b4a101e0a1428198323e16fb)

People obviously hyperfixate on hands now adays to argue AI, but I also think jewelry is overlooked as an indicator. This artwork of Harley Quinn is what completely sold me. Look at her necklace.

Who are the greatest human scientists in the DC Universe?,"Hey, fellow DC Fans of Reddit!
I had a question that has been boggling my mind for a while now. I thought of this question while I was watching the animated film The Batman vs. Dracula. I wanted to know who were the greatest human scientific minds in the DC Universe. Who are the most brilliant human scientists the DCU has to offer? Could you guys, kindly, tell me who you think should be on that list? I assume Bruce Wayne is somewhere on that list because‚Ä¶he's Batman. Could you guys also tell me your reasoning as to why a particular person should be on the list?

Thanks, fellow DC fans. Have a great one, everybody!

My DCU (Chapter 1: Gods on Earth- Act 1),"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm kinda new here, but this idea has been brewing in my mind for a while! DC is one of my favorite franchises EVER, and I‚Äôve always wanted to see a complete, linear, epic series of movies and shows for it like what Marvel has! Only problem is that so far, the DCEU was kinda... not good, and not what I‚Äôd wanted. I‚Äôm confident that James Gunn has a good plan in mind, but that‚Äôs his vision, and this is mine! I will be following the Apokolips saga path that Snyder and the animated movies followed, but it will be my own version completely separate from both projects (for the most part)! This is only my first phase (or act as I like to call it), but I hope you all enjoy and I can tell you about more!

The projects are in the following order, in case anyone is curious:

1. Superman: The Man of Tomorrow (film)
2. Batman: The Caped Crusaders (film)
3. Wonder Woman and the Justice Society (film)
4. Nightwing (film)
5. The Flash: Fastest Man Alive (film)

Discussion about the Crisis on Two Earths animated movie," SPOILERS maybe. The discussion is about an important quote from the movie.  


 TL;DR I think the peak-you-blinked-scene may be not that peak, since what I've learned about Nietzsche's quote is that actually Batman would be the one who blinked in this metaphor.

  
 When I first watched the movie I thought the use of Nietzsche's catchphrase was very peak (he was known for using it when he went to fight crime and stuff). It's been used in a lot of superhero stuff, it's in Watchmen, it's in like 40 Batman stuff, it's in the beginning of the Infinity Gauntlet too if I'm not mistaken.

&amp;#x200B;

  Batman tells that the difference between him and Owlman is that both stared at the abyss, but Owlman blinked. The original quote from Beyond Good &amp; Evil and the sentence before is:  


 ""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee. ""  


 I believe this means that if you stare into the abyss for long enough, get your hands too dirty, per say, you'll be inevitably changed by the things you're trying to deal with, maybe become a part of it. So... If Batman is the guy who can deal with the horrors of Gotham and doesn't become an cold blooded assassin and Owlman is the one who was inevitably changed by all of this and became a nihilist who doesn't care about the importance of life, Batman should be the one who blinked and Owlman should be the one who stared into the abyss for too long.  


My question is, is Friedrich Nietzsche stupid? Did he not read the Infinity Gauntlet?   


Now seriously, do you have another interpretation of this scene that is more compatible? I'm seriously thinking the writers of the movie just didn't dive in the metaphor deep enough to see that the point was that Batman doesn't gaze into the abyss long enought for it to gaze back at him.

Custom Raven I just finished up,,DCcomics,14,0.8
I reworked my pitch for an R-rated Green Lantern film with Kyle Rayner (played by Xolo Maridue√±a),"Plot:

On Planet OA, Parallax infects the entirety of the Green Lantern Corp with his fear virus, causing them to fight each other and essentially cause a Green Lantern Civil War. After the brutal fighting, the Corp is wiped out. Ganthet, the last surviving Guardian of The Universe, uses a boom tube to head to Earth.

On Earth, in Star City, 25-year-old, Kyle Rayner, is a struggling artist, who works part-time as a janitor for an organization called Cadmus. While walking home, Kyle finds Ganthet withering in an alleyway. Ganthet uses his ring to scan Kyle and determine that he's a worthy host. Kyle is given the ring before Ganthet dies in the alley.

Over the next couple of days, Kyle is learning how to use his ring. Ganthet uploads his consciousness into the ring and acts as a mentor (like Obi-Wan Kenobi). As Kyle is training, he learns that Cadmus discovered a meteor from deep space, which has unusual energy signals within it. Cadmus's head scientist, Hector Hammond, opens the meteor and is infected with Parallax's fear virus. Hector is now under the command of Parallax and infects all the Cadmus employees with the fear virus. Hector and the infected employees plan to use Cadmus's dark matter energy core to create a wormhole that will directly link to OA so that Parallax can release his fear virus on Earth from OA.

Kyle decides to accept his role as Green Lantern and goes to stop Hector. There's a very violent battle at The Cadmus Facility, all the fear-infected individuals fight Kyle with everything they can. However, Hector creates the wormhole and Parallax begins to release his fear virus. Kyle uses his ring to block the wormhole but he knows he can't do it for long. After some encouragement from Ganthet, Kyle manages to close the wormhole and save Earth. In the end, Kyle becomes Earth's protector.

Throughout the film, we see a romance between Kyle and Alexandra DeWitt, a photographer at the local paper. At the end of the film, they hook up.

Anyway, that's the plot, a big improvement on my last draft. Also, it'd still be an Elseworld Movie, with no Justice League or big superhero teams, except for easter eggs and references to Superman, Alan Scott, Martian Manhunter, and The JSA.

  
Post Credit Scene:

Kyle hovers over Star City, but he's approached by an unknown figure who's also levitating. Kyle turns around to see Alan Scott, dawned in his iconic red outfit and green cape, wearing a power ring. ""You're not the only Lantern left,"" Alan says.

Questions about Caitlin Fairchild's Powers and Age (CONFUSED),"FYI, yes, I know there's more than one version of this character, cause it originally belonged to Wildstorm, then Wildstorm got sold to DC, etc, etc.

My question is about the current version of the character, the one in the DC Comics Universe (that is also a clone apparently...)

In these images you can see that when Caitlin isn't using her powers, she looks like a literal kid, a child, a brat,. But when she uses her powers, not only she gets harder, better, faster, stronger, etc, **she also transforms into a grown woman.**

**I went to the wiki for clarification on what was going on,** **to see if it was a Billy Batson situation,** but seeing the powers listed on the wiki not only did not explain what was going on, they also managed to leave me even more confused.

It mentions a **""Transformation""** and a **""Superhuman Form""** but it explicitly states that **all this transformation does is it enhances her muscle mass, and as a result that enhances her physical attributes** (again... harder, better, faster, stronger, etc,). with all that out of the way my questions are:

**If what supposedly happens when Caitlin transforms is she gets more buff with muscle mass, then why does she get taller, looks older and gain bigger boobs?**

Is the clone ""**original form""** the **little girl?** or is it the **grown woman?**

...what is going on?

Superboy (1994 3rd Series) Review 0-100,"I just did a reread of one of my favorites as a kid. I entered the hobby at the Death of Superman and read Knightfall, but the first series that I felt was mine, that I was excited to read each month of Superboy by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett.

You can essential divide the run into 4 parts. The first part 1-30 is (largely) Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett. It tells the story of Superboy's establishing himself as he hero of Hawaii, his relationship with Tana Moon, and a wonderful cast of characters (Dubbilex, Rex and Roxie Leach, Knockout) culminating in the 6 part Losin' It storyline where Superboy nearly throws it all away. It's a great run marred only by the loss of Grummett for most of the Losin' It issues. It spans World's Collide (Milestone universe), the Zero Hour, and Underworld Unleashed events.

The second part is largely written by Ron Marz running from 31-49. I remember being a little disappointed that Kesel and Grummett had left the title, and actually stopped buying it at issue 41. It was years later that I picked up another chunk and rereading them now, it's not as bad. There are a few major elements that come out of this run, the climatic storyline being the five parter Meltdown. There is an issue in the Final Night storyline too.

The third part is the (triumphal) return to the title by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett, running from 50-79. I didn't return to the title because my teenage funds were limited and I was buying Image at the time, but the lot I picked up had Marz's and most of Kesel's run. On first reading it didn't get me back to that level of excitement I had when I was a teen, but on this read through I really enjoyed it. Lots of fun storytelling, new characters, a new situations. Living at Cadmus lent itself to encountering the New Gods, and getting involved in the wider DC world. There's a couple of big storylines Hyper-Tension is a 6 parter, and then the climactic Sins of Youth crossover. There's also a Day of Judgement event tie-in.

The final part runs from 80-100, primarily written by Joe Kelly and then a team-up of Palmiotti and Didio. This was the part that prompted my rereading because when I first read it, I didn't have an appreciation of Kelly at all. But after enjoying some of his other works, I began to suspect that maybe I was being too harsh on it. I wasn't a fan of the art and sometimes that can ruin the whole book. Unfortunately, the book is as bad as I remember. It is aimless, full of lame humor, taking Superboy away from his supporting cast that had been developed for 80 issues, from a dynamic story setting at Cadmus to a dreary setting as the caretaker of an apartment complex. I'm not against big shifts, but it's hard to see this as anything more than a desperation to keep it going to achieve 100 issues. It's bad and a sad end to a mostly strong run.

Down the road, I'll happily recommend the first 82 issues, but I advise you to drop it once Kelly arrives.",DCcomics,8,0.76

Hypothetically speaking what if it was Superman. Wonder woman. Batman. Flash. Hawk girl and Ra's himself. Would he end up making an abomination with all of their spliced DNA or would he make respawn but with not all of the abilities from all of the DNA donors?

This has been on my mind ever since I started thinking about Superboy and how he is a clone of lex and Superman but earlier I saw a post about how Superboy doesn't seem to have the same intelligence as lex luthor?

If I Were to Restart the DC Cinematic Universe ,"Edit: a quick Google search has shown me that James Gunn is already doing a thing with this so this whole post is kind of moot.

Preface: I am not commenting on any of the movies, I am not offering opinions on any of that or anything that might start controversy; this is merely the musings of a madman, albeit, a madman that wishes to remain polite and courteous to their fellow redditors. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I am not up to date on the last ten years of comics and the last 5 years of DC movies. 

I digress.

If I were going to restart the DC films, I would open up with a Booster Gold movie. 

Why? 

He‚Äôs obscure enough that most casual fans don‚Äôt know who he is ‚Äî and I think that works to everyone‚Äôs artistic benefit. Less preconceived notions on the audience‚Äôs behalf going in. Some people might not even know he‚Äôs from
DC, without the branding. 

He has an amazing redemption arc in the form of Rip Hunter‚Äôs lackey in keeping the timeline secure.  Plus, his existence really makes it easy to lean into any of the 52/multiverse stuff if they wanted to. 

And, because his origin story leaves a pretty large opportunity to establish a cinematic franchise/the potential rosters of the JLA. 

For those not hip to BG: he‚Äôs from the future and a washed up jock working at a museum, until he steals a bunch of old superhero tech from the museum, travels into the past to modern times to establish an overly commercial identity as a superhero. Naturally, he does every bit of product placement you could imagine. The other heroes hate him for it ‚Äî but that‚Äôs also why he was chosen to help keep the timelime secure‚Ä¶ because nobody would suspect he would be trusted with such a responsibility. 

I dunno, I think it would be a really easy film to write and something that wouldn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. I‚Äôm sure someone else has pitched this before.

"What is the best Green Lantern book to read, set prior to its Dawn of DC era? aka is it Grant Morrison's The Green Lantern?","So I've been plotting my return to comics via graphic novels regarding certain characters. And I have a system in place, sorta speak (more accidental), that involves getting a story(ies) that happened before the ""main point"". I know this makes no sense, so I'll try to explain in detail.

For Superman, it was Warworld; the epic saga that was the best Superman story in years, and it help guide me to his current era with the relaunch and Dawn of DC directive of Superman and Action Comics. For Batman, it was Joker War that sets up the current status quo of the character; for Wonder Woman, it was Trial of the Amazons, and for The Flash, the One Minute War.

For Green Lantern, its...well, thats the point of this topic.

I asked recently about Dark Crisis, and everyone said to skip it. Now part of the reason why I was curious about that event was its explanation toward Earth being quarantine, and its connection to Green Lantern with the Corps and Oa, etc. But the fact that its skippable means to just go into GL's Dawn of DC era with no issues, and after reading issue 1, I see alot has changed but easy to follow. 

Still, is there something else to get instead?

Looking at everything Green Lantern prior to Dark Crisis/Dawn of DC, I think the answer might be Grant Morrison's The Green Lantern. I don't recall any negative reactions toward his run, and my research is suggesting no issues that would affect me either. 

Question is: is his title the answer, or am I missing something? Another title that I missed or perhaps didn't think was important, but is the answer.

My Idea to justify why Batman doesn't kill the joker,"The fact that the joker still survive despite everything he has done is 

Gouvernment hates superheroes. They need them to deal with Big problems, sure. But they can't control them. A superhero like superman is seen a danger to the legitimity of the authority. There is also the fact their int√©rests almost always clashs . To simplify things, If superheroes in g√©n√©ral are neutral good, politicians are lawful neutral or lawful evil (the majority are lawful evil)

So the reason why military programs to take down superheroes and teams like the suicide squad exist. They just need a good reason  justify hunting down the classic super-heros and replace them with their american-sanctionned supers

With this. The question we need to Ask now is no longer ""why Batman doesn't kill the joker"" but ""why no one else including cops or the justice system is dealing with him"" ""why does he goes to an Asylum despite the fact he isn't crazy enough to benifice of the insanity plea ?"" 

The answer is simple: he's a bait. One day Batman will kill him which will be a good enough reason to hunt him down, stop him and/or kill him and replace him with superheroes 100% loyal to the american gouvernment. The kind that would Never disobey and Always follow orders .
The kind that would restore and maintain order in Gotham (in a incredibly fascist and corrupted way I mean)

"To me, the best Superman story of all time is Kingdom Come"," I remember first buying the hardcover edition which contained the whole series sometime in 1996 or 97 while I was on deployment in the Navy. Read it multiple times and it has stayed with me ever since.

And the reason why I think it's the best Superman story is because it didn't take the low hanging fruit approach, which is making Superman dark and edgy, or making him bewitched by red kryptonite or whatever.

Instead, Superman lost faith in society because society had lost faith in him. To me, this is profound. Superman's powers have always come not from the yellow sun, but by the people's faith in him that he would always do the right thing. He was the ideal we aspired to, even if we knew we never really could.

That loss of faith lead Superman to exile himself, and leave the world to its own fate. My reaction to that today is the same as it was back then: *Holy crap!*

Even back in the 90s, Superman was seen as a dinosaur with outdated morals and principals. Society wanted darker and grittier heroes who would kill bad guys on sight. They wanted more heroes like Batman and The Punisher (even though he's from Marvel).

The entire story was about how Superman and the classic members of the Justice League - including Batman! - gathered up all the new age superheroes and tried to show them what it meant to actually be a superhero. It was such an amazing story, and I don't really see writing like that today when it comes to Supes.

I have no idea what the new Superman movie will be about, but I sincerely hope at some point, someone tells a Superman story similar to that. Not just him saving the world from Zod or Darkseid, but grappling with an enemy more powerful than all of them: loss of hope.

A plot idea for a Mr. Freeze Solo Movie,"Inspired by some old posts I found on this sub-reddit and the less than optimistic response to my recent post on WB producing solo character driven movies for DC villains like Mr. Freeze, I decided to come up with a short plot of what a potential Mr. Freeze solo movie could be.

Let me know what you're all think:

In the heart of Gotham City, lived Victor Fries, a brilliant scientist whose life was forever altered by the warmth of love and the cold embrace of loss.

The movie begins with a glimpse into Victor's past, a time when he was not yet known as the notorious Mr. Freeze. In those early days, he was a man of science, devoted to his research and driven by a relentless curiosity about the world around him. But amidst the sterile confines of his laboratory, there was a spark of humanity that set him apart ‚Äì the love of his life, Nora.

Nora was unlike anyone Victor had ever known ‚Äì a beacon of light in his otherwise solitary existence. With her gentle smile and kind heart, she thawed the icy walls Victor had built around himself, bringing warmth and joy into his life. Their romance blossomed slowly, like a delicate flower unfurling its petals in the warmth of the sun.

As the movie unfolds, we witness the tender moments shared between Victor and Nora ‚Äì picnics in the park, late-night stargazing sessions, and stolen kisses in the moonlight. Their love is a force of nature, binding them together in a bond that transcends time and space.

But even the brightest flames are not immune to the chill of adversity, and tragedy soon strikes the young couple. Nora falls gravely ill, her once vibrant spirit dimmed by the specter of a deadly disease. As her condition worsens, Victor's world is plunged into darkness once more, his heart heavy with the weight of impending loss.

Determined to save the woman he loves, Victor throws himself into his work with renewed vigor, searching tirelessly for a cure to Nora's illness. Days turn into weeks, and weeks into months, but still, he refuses to give up hope. His laboratory becomes a sanctuary of sorts, a place where science and love intertwine in a desperate bid for salvation.

But fate is a cruel mistress, and despite Victor's best efforts, Nora's condition continues to deteriorate. As her life hangs in the balance, Victor is faced with an impossible choice ‚Äì to accept defeat or to defy the laws of nature itself. And so, with a heavy heart and a determined spirit, he embarks on a journey that will forever alter the course of his destiny.

The romantic part of the movie is not merely a subplot but the very heart and soul of the story, illuminating the depths of Victor and Nora's love and the lengths to which they will go to protect it. Theirs is a love story for the ages, a tale of passion, sacrifice, and redemption that will linger in the hearts of audiences long after the credits roll.

If WB could greenlight films such as "" Isn't it romantic"" , "" A Hollywood Christmas"" and "" Locked down"", I see no reason why they can't give this a serious consideration.

[other] Looking for a specific Green Lantern comic which i can't find anymore.,"When i started reading the green lantern i found myself reading a retelling of sorts of Hal Jordan.

Some q's about YJ and KonCass,"So for the past week or so, I've spent a lot of time reading old serials of pre-flashpoint YJ and new 52 Teen titans, namely because of how Cassie and Conner (even Kon) are some of my favorite legacy characters (second only to the fab5). As such I have a few questions to ask. 1) Does Cassie remember the new52? I know Tim does. 2) Does no one remember Kon-El? Even Cassie? I mean she was kinda in a relationship with him.  Basically I don't get how Kon-El just randomly disappeared after all the adventures he had and how the titans just forgot about him, ik its something about harvest. 3) this is prob a common question but do you guys think we'll ever get KonCass again? I really wanna see them again and since Dawn of DC has been reviving lost relationships (DickBabs, HalCarol), can they also get revived? They haven't announced a dawn of DC YJ series yet although it makes sense why because of the Titans being the flag front. One more thinggg, have they announced a dawn of dc supergirl series because I am so confused on her origin story and if the thing about Zor-El being cyborg superman is still canon coz Zor-El got revived pre-flashpoint too.",DCcomics,0,0.33

Make him Superboy and give conner a new code name maybe valor
Brake up him and jay he a boring character how is that I feel like Jon had more chemistry with ash (the person in the lazarus planet assault on krypton anthology with Jon)

(Getting back into Comics) Looking for some community recommendations and sign posting," I have always been a very casual comic hobbyist when I was last reading at the start of Rebirth. I am looking for some recommendations from the community, I know I can get some of the answers from Google, but am looking for some human experience and feedback. So if anyone could take the time to answer/give their opinion on one or more of my questions that would be fantastic.

Current and Historical reads:

Anything Superman(Inc. family stuff)

Constantine (Reading Marks of Woe, and the best version of you)

Injustice (Read all 5 years I believe)

Preacher (Book one TPB in post)

   
 Q1: I read roughly the first quarter of nearly everything DC Rebirth, but never experienced any of the big reveals. Do you think it's worth revisiting, if so is there a recommended order and set of TPB you can recommend?

Q2: What is the current continuity?  is it linked to Rebirth at all? Is the current line of books well-perceived and worth looking into?

Q3 My Missy watched the Sandman TV show without telling me or being aware it was comic adjacent and loved it. She has never read a comic in her life, and I have not read Sandman in the past (I'm aware my current read of Hellblazer is Sandman universe) is there a current line of Sandman TPB I can buy for her to enjoy? Happy for stories told in the TV show or not.

Q4: Appreciate this is not an exact science, but further recommendations for other books/lines my partner might enjoy if she enjoyed Sandman? (seems to like the concepts of the endless and Biblical stuff)

Q5: Swamp Thing have you read it and would you recommend it? would you start from the start or jump into a newer line (if it exists) TPB recommendations and general advice / pre-reading appreciated.

Q6: What is considered a hot comic line currently, wither you agree with it or not?

Q7: I seem to prefer the Vertigo, Black label lines( from my limited experience) can you recommend any books you personally love, can be any character and I will consider it for future reads.",DCcomics,1,0.57

"Hello, I need some directions- Never read comics before","Heya, so I need some directions- I want to read some batman comics because I really like the character, but I dont particularly enjoy superhero stories, its just batman specifically that I found a really fun concept.

This is why I wanted to ask you where one should start from my position when reading batman comics, I'm not likely to read a lot of them (hell I'd want to but I just know myself well enough to know it wouldnt happen), I'm just in the middle of Malazan and wanted to try something different, so I'd appreciate a recommendation of maybe three titles I could possibly read that could show me the best of this character.

"Screw your favorite run, what‚Äôs your most hated run (or miniseries) on a character you really like","I‚Äôll start off with two. 

1. Chuck Austen‚Äôs Superman man. Want a Superman run written by a guy who really DOESN‚ÄôT like Superman? Not a doesn‚Äôt get or wants to change Superman for different times, I mean full on does not like him? You got Chuck‚Äôs run. Where he battles his arch enemy, Repo Man, The Kingdom Gog, and his own wife in a battle for truth, Justice, and really being angry and mean at everyone. Superman is very downright unpleasant this run, and it‚Äôs actually really funny how much of a jerk he is. How LAME his villains are, from a Doomsday who is more like Lenny from Mice and Men to the invincible unstoppable omnipotent Repo Man! This is a run I have plenty of fun laughing at, but actually reading it is a painful chore. 

2. Vendetti Flash. I like Vendetti, but man did not get how to write the Flash. Everything is just wild and seems to be just throwing stuff at the wall, a Reverse Flash who is near nothing like Eobard and nothing like Hunter, a police captain who now hates the Flash for the crime of BEING REALLY FAST, and a random Riddler arc slammed into it. Nothing works in the run, from Wally‚Äôs character arc to anything Iris did to Henry Allen suddenly breaking out of jail to kill some guy who he apparently hated. It‚Äôs far more enjoyable than Austen‚Äôs run and while not as bad, is rather just incompetent. 

Any other runs you find rather bad, or just baffling in how funnily bad it is, please send! I don‚Äôt have any bile for these runs BTW, I just find them amusing in how bad they are.",DCcomics,48,0.86

[Discussion] Just finished reading Benjamin Percy's run on Green Arrow," Been meaning to check out this run for a while now and I finally did. 

Overall, I'd say it was good, with a stretch of it (volume 4 and 5) being legit great. I think Percy gets the essence of the character, which is always essential imo. There is nothing groundbreaking in his run but its generally solid. I preferred the art when it is handled by Otto Schmidt, but the other artists did a good job too. I'll always appreciate ""fighting the bigget man"" storylines, so it was nice seeing Ollie's rebirth over the course of the run.

Unfortunately I thought the last volume was super rushed, with major pacing issues and soap opera-esque plot twists and character beats that kinda soured what came before.

I think it is definitely worth a read overall if you enjoy the character. It flirts with being great but I'd say it was ""good enough"".",DCcomics,36,0.9

But every once in a while I‚Äôll have some downtime and do my best to catch up on all of the many months worth of comics I have stacked up. 

The problem is that if I wanted to read the comics in their release order (like all of them that came out in the same week/month), I‚Äôve now got to look up when all of them came out because it isn‚Äôt clearly printed anywhere on the cover.

Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, they do not, with them each being separate depictions of Gotham City and its cast of characters.

Personally, I don't mind this decision. It allows for more creative expressions between each property, allowing the filmmakers of both projects to not worry about continuity between films and whatnot. I mean, if they were in the same universe, that would be Batman would fight a very old Joker, seeing as how he was already an adult in his movie, with Bruce still a child. You'd be hard pressed to make a compelling Batman vs Joker story with that premise (maybe an interesting comedy perhaps).

This post, unlike others that speculate what if both movies shared a universe, rather asks what if both movies were one. Basically, what if both the plots of Joker and The Batman were mixed together into one movie? What changes would you make to have it all make sense?",DCcomics,0,0.12

Does anyone have any suggestions for the leotard/corset (I am leaning towards the latter or at least a Leo that shows off some cleavage üòâ) and the jacket (I'm looking for something a little thinner but maybe still leatherish if possible).

I'm looking to see if anyone knows where to look or if anyone who has cosplayed BC before would recommend something specific.

Earth 3 Counterpart Suggestions?,"For those of you who don't know, Earth 3 is a universe where heroes are villains, and vice versa. It's ruled by the Crime Syndicate, with Ultraman being evil superman, Owlman being evil Batman. Do any of you all have ideas for these alternate counterparts for characters?  


I'll post two of my ideas below.  


Bioluminescence is the alternate version of Black Manta that is a sort of ""champion of two worlds"". David Hyde was born as a child of two worlds, to two humans on the surface that quickly became enamored with Atlantis. I see Bioluminescence as a sort of freedom fighter against the reign of Sea King, and filling the same ""hero of both worlds"". He's almost a comedically good person, having a strong code against killing, and pretty much dedicating his life to try and redeem Sea King into a good king and leader for his people, while helping for small groups of Atlanteans that live against his rule.  


The Gull is the alternate version of the Penguin that was a formerly wealthy. Oswald Cobblepot was a  bleeding heart millionaire that ran afoul with corrupt billionaire Bruce Wayne, who managed to cheat him out of most of hi, forcing him to go underground. He rose up as the Gull- an underground psuedo mob boss that has become something of a hero for the city's underprivileged. He operates through informants of the city's lowest- vagrants and the homeless, those who Owlman nor the corrupt GCPD pay much attention to, gathering information to hopefully drive his fascistic reign to an end.

Starro the Conqueror (modern take),"So with the advent of a licensed table-top roleplaying game (TTRPG) from the ""other publisher"", I've taken it upon myself to make custom DC characters playable within it.  I've a question about Starro the Conqueror: is his modern concept still the giant alien starfish that continues to grow in size with the more beings he controls?  I saw some indications of a humanoid-looking Starro and was wondering if this is the modern-day Starro, a sort of ""avatar"" of Starro, etc.  This thread has been quick to response before and I really appreciate it!

Incidentally, is anyone familiar with the aforementioned TTRPG from the big ""M""?  And if so, are you interested in seeing any of my DC builds for it?  I've made a bunch on Demiplane and more in the works, but it helps if you have the aforementioned game and some familiarity with it, as the stat blocks are a little unconventional from previous superhero RPGs.

Thanks again in advance, and please don't hate me!!  I want to represent DC well as a valuable resource for those interested!",DCcomics,0,0.5

Should Barry Allen be older or younger?,"So I have been working on a big DC Universe fancast for several years now at this point, but I started wondering this question recently. How old should Barry Allen be?

I should note I had set this fancast universe to have started in 2013, just to work with some actors at certain ages. I had Dylan O'Brien locked in for a while now, but recently other castings I started doing for Nightwing and such have made me start wondering about other casting ideas. 

Anyways the main point is that it got me thinking about what Barry's accepted age range should be? Either in his early to mid 20s, or around is early to mid 30s. Because I think the two recent live action iterations have contributed to this confusion. Grant Gustin was 23 when he first started playing Barry Allen, and Ezra Miller was 22. As well, other Barry's have been depicted as younger recently as well, like Kill the Justice League Barry who says he is youngest member and acts like it.

But then there has been other depictions where he is shown as older. Like John Wesley Shipp was 35 when he first played Barry. As well several other versions from cartoons and games is shown as older at least, like Young Justice, the Tomorrowverse, Batman The Brave and the Bold and Injustice.

So I've become a little confused about this then, especially since age in comics is weird. If you add Wally into the mix when he becomes Flash, then Barry should be older, but then lately they show him as younger. 

I don't know. I was wondering if anyone had a answer to this? Like do the comics point to him being a definitive age range among the League? Or does it possibly not matter, he can be either based on your preference, considering all these different depictions.",DCcomics,2,0.56

Also it was stated that Mark Waid was gonna be writing all ‚Äú25 issues‚Äù of the event, which we know isn‚Äôt true. He is only writing the main series.

Guys need opinions on a decision related to comics ,"So as I have mentioned before I'm a old comics fan I have read both marvel and DC even some image and valiant. I used to read comics a lot during my teenage years, years ago but I stopped and been reading only manga for a while but lately I have been getting the feeling to return to comics which I kinda did since last week I have been reading Superman and action comics 90s since I didn't get to read them years ago I've only read Superman 2000s, new 52 and rebirth . 

And I still enjoy comics so I'm confused whether to fully return to comics or stay sticking only to manga like I have been since years now since doing both will overwhelming I still got a lot manga on my reading list I plan to read if I add also comics I'll be overwhelmed especially for DC . As for marvel I have already read nearly every marvel character their 90s, 2000s, 2010s comics I only got newerer current marvel comics to read . DC I have read a lot of it too in the past but not everything there's still some older DC titles I didn't read besides the newer current titles .

So if anyone wants to give their opinion what to choose whether manga or comics ? ",DCcomics,0,0.33

[Discussion] Is DC using a cover artist that is using AI?,"This artist, Leirix ([who has an instagram that shows her making art pre-AI, as well as traditional art pieces](https://instagram.com/leirixart)), has done a lot of variant covers for DC (and Marvel), but to me these cover arts all kind of scream AI. Take a look at Wonder Woman #5:

[Notice Wonder Woman's hand, as well as the thumb on the peace sign. The mouths being drawn that way also seems very common in recent stable diffusion AI pieces.](https://preview.redd.it/pjlxfca81xvc1.jpg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b825ca8aa9cb22d1e5eca5e4772a4b78bc123697)

Flash #8 has this art:

[Look at the hands of Irey West on her waist, the line art of both characters also seems extremely inconsistent with normal digital artwork, like on the back of Jessie's leg.](https://preview.redd.it/e8a08da81xvc1.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=772d3e5028a45047b4a101e0a1428198323e16fb)

People obviously hyperfixate on hands now adays to argue AI, but I also think jewelry is overlooked as an indicator. This artwork of Harley Quinn is what completely sold me. Look at her necklace.

&amp;#x200B;

[That is definitely not human made.](https://preview.redd.it/qtqrphw43xvc1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de97ab2a7549fe0b4f963cd09e87117741ea5ba6)

My DCU (Chapter 1: Gods on Earth- Act 1),"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm kinda new here, but this idea has been brewing in my mind for a while! DC is one of my favorite franchises EVER, and I‚Äôve always wanted to see a complete, linear, epic series of movies and shows for it like what Marvel has! Only problem is that so far, the DCEU was kinda... not good, and not what I‚Äôd wanted. I‚Äôm confident that James Gunn has a good plan in mind, but that‚Äôs his vision, and this is mine! I will be following the Apokolips saga path that Snyder and the animated movies followed, but it will be my own version completely separate from both projects (for the most part)! This is only my first phase (or act as I like to call it), but I hope you all enjoy and I can tell you about more!

The projects are in the following order, in case anyone is curious:

1. Superman: The Man of Tomorrow (film)
2. Batman: The Caped Crusaders (film)
3. Wonder Woman and the Justice Society (film)
4. Nightwing (film)
5. The Flash: Fastest Man Alive (film)
6. Green Lantern: Emerald Guardian (film)
7. Aquaman: King of Atlantis (film)

Discussion about the Crisis on Two Earths animated movie," SPOILERS maybe. The discussion is about an important quote from the movie.  


 TL;DR I think the peak-you-blinked-scene may be not that peak, since what I've learned about Nietzsche's quote is that actually Batman would be the one who blinked in this metaphor.

  
 When I first watched the movie I thought the use of Nietzsche's catchphrase was very peak (he was known for using it when he went to fight crime and stuff). It's been used in a lot of superhero stuff, it's in Watchmen, it's in like 40 Batman stuff, it's in the beginning of the Infinity Gauntlet too if I'm not mistaken.

&amp;#x200B;

  Batman tells that the difference between him and Owlman is that both stared at the abyss, but Owlman blinked. The original quote from Beyond Good &amp; Evil and the sentence before is:  


 ""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee. ""  


 I believe this means that if you stare into the abyss for long enough, get your hands too dirty, per say, you'll be inevitably changed by the things you're trying to deal with, maybe become a part of it. So... If Batman is the guy who can deal with the horrors of Gotham and doesn't become an cold blooded assassin and Owlman is the one who was inevitably changed by all of this and became a nihilist who doesn't care about the importance of life, Batman should be the one who blinked and Owlman should be the one who stared into the abyss for too long.  


My question is, is Friedrich Nietzsche stupid? Did he not read the Infinity Gauntlet?   


Now seriously, do you have another interpretation of this scene that is more compatible? I'm seriously thinking the writers of the movie just didn't dive in the metaphor deep enough to see that the point was that Batman doesn't gaze into the abyss long enought for it to gaze back at him.

Custom Raven I just finished up,,DCcomics,13,0.77
I reworked my pitch for an R-rated Green Lantern film with Kyle Rayner (played by Xolo Maridue√±a),"Plot:

On Planet OA, Parallax infects the entirety of the Green Lantern Corp with his fear virus, causing them to fight each other and essentially cause a Green Lantern Civil War. After the brutal fighting, the Corp is wiped out. Ganthet, the last surviving Guardian of The Universe, uses a boom tube to head to Earth.

On Earth, in Star City, 25-year-old, Kyle Rayner, is a struggling artist, who works part-time as a janitor for an organization called Cadmus. While walking home, Kyle finds Ganthet withering in an alleyway. Ganthet uses his ring to scan Kyle and determine that he's a worthy host. Kyle is given the ring before Ganthet dies in the alley.

Over the next couple of days, Kyle is learning how to use his ring. Ganthet uploads his consciousness into the ring and acts as a mentor (like Obi-Wan Kenobi). As Kyle is training, he learns that Cadmus discovered a meteor from deep space, which has unusual energy signals within it. Cadmus's head scientist, Hector Hammond, opens the meteor and is infected with Parallax's fear virus. Hector is now under the command of Parallax and infects all the Cadmus employees with the fear virus. Hector and the infected employees plan to use Cadmus's dark matter energy core to create a wormhole that will directly link to OA so that Parallax can release his fear virus on Earth from OA.

Kyle decides to accept his role as Green Lantern and goes to stop Hector. There's a very violent battle at The Cadmus Facility, all the fear-infected individuals fight Kyle with everything they can. However, Hector creates the wormhole and Parallax begins to release his fear virus. Kyle uses his ring to block the wormhole but he knows he can't do it for long. After some encouragement from Ganthet, Kyle manages to close the wormhole and save Earth. In the end, Kyle becomes Earth's protector.

Throughout the film, we see a romance between Kyle and Alexandra DeWitt, a photographer at the local paper. At the end of the film, they hook up.

Anyway, that's the plot, a big improvement on my last draft. Also, it'd still be an Elseworld Movie, with no Justice League or big superhero teams, except for easter eggs and references to Superman, Alan Scott, Martian Manhunter, and The JSA.

  
Post Credit Scene:

Kyle hovers over Star City, but he's approached by an unknown figure who's also levitating. Kyle turns around to see Alan Scott, dawned in his iconic red outfit and green cape, wearing a power ring. ""You're not the only Lantern left,"" Alan says.

Cast:

Xolo Maridue√±a as Kyle Rayner

Madison Hu as Alexandra DeWitt

Tim Blake Nelson as Hector Hammond

Benedict Cumberbatch as Parallax (Voice)

Michael Shannon as Ganthet

Tobey Maguire as Alan Scott

Director: Andres Muschietti

Questions about Caitlin Fairchild's Powers and Age (CONFUSED),"FYI, yes, I know there's more than one version of this character, cause it originally belonged to Wildstorm, then Wildstorm got sold to DC, etc, etc.

My question is about the current version of the character, the one in the DC Comics Universe (that is also a clone apparently...)

https://preview.redd.it/y1h3hinzljvc1.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5fb414bee5ce4d73b79ae2e35888150e28f86b9

In these images you can see that when Caitlin isn't using her powers, she looks like a literal kid, a child, a brat,. But when she uses her powers, not only she gets harder, better, faster, stronger, etc, **she also transforms into a grown woman.**

**I went to the wiki for clarification on what was going on,** **to see if it was a Billy Batson situation,** but seeing the powers listed on the wiki not only did not explain what was going on, they also managed to leave me even more confused.

It mentions a **""Transformation""** and a **""Superhuman Form""** but it explicitly states that **all this transformation does is it enhances her muscle mass, and as a result that enhances her physical attributes** (again... harder, better, faster, stronger, etc,). with all that out of the way my questions are:

**If what supposedly happens when Caitlin transforms is she gets more buff with muscle mass, then why does she get taller, looks older and gain bigger boobs?**

Is the clone ""**original form""** the **little girl?** or is it the **grown woman?**

...what is going on?

Superboy (1994 3rd Series) Review 0-100,"I just did a reread of one of my favorites as a kid. I entered the hobby at the Death of Superman and read Knightfall, but the first series that I felt was mine, that I was excited to read each month of Superboy by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett.

You can essential divide the run into 4 parts. The first part 1-30 is (largely) Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett. It tells the story of Superboy's establishing himself as he hero of Hawaii, his relationship with Tana Moon, and a wonderful cast of characters (Dubbilex, Rex and Roxie Leach, Knockout) culminating in the 6 part Losin' It storyline where Superboy nearly throws it all away. It's a great run marred only by the loss of Grummett for most of the Losin' It issues. It spans World's Collide (Milestone universe), the Zero Hour, and Underworld Unleashed events.

The second part is largely written by Ron Marz running from 31-49. I remember being a little disappointed that Kesel and Grummett had left the title, and actually stopped buying it at issue 41. It was years later that I picked up another chunk and rereading them now, it's not as bad. There are a few major elements that come out of this run, the climatic storyline being the five parter Meltdown. There is an issue in the Final Night storyline too.

The third part is the (triumphal) return to the title by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett, running from 50-79. I didn't return to the title because my teenage funds were limited and I was buying Image at the time, but the lot I picked up had Marz's and most of Kesel's run. On first reading it didn't get me back to that level of excitement I had when I was a teen, but on this read through I really enjoyed it. Lots of fun storytelling, new characters, a new situations. Living at Cadmus lent itself to encountering the New Gods, and getting involved in the wider DC world. There's a couple of big storylines Hyper-Tension is a 6 parter, and then the climactic Sins of Youth crossover. There's also a Day of Judgement event tie-in.

The final part runs from 80-100, primarily written by Joe Kelly and then a team-up of Palmiotti and Didio. This was the part that prompted my rereading because when I first read it, I didn't have an appreciation of Kelly at all. But after enjoying some of his other works, I began to suspect that maybe I was being too harsh on it. I wasn't a fan of the art and sometimes that can ruin the whole book. Unfortunately, the book is as bad as I remember. It is aimless, full of lame humor, taking Superboy away from his supporting cast that had been developed for 80 issues, from a dynamic story setting at Cadmus to a dreary setting as the caretaker of an apartment complex. I'm not against big shifts, but it's hard to see this as anything more than a desperation to keep it going to achieve 100 issues. It's bad and a sad end to a mostly strong run.

Down the road, I'll happily recommend the first 82 issues, but I advise you to drop it once Kelly arrives.",DCcomics,8,0.76

So just out of curiosity. This just came to me. Respawn from the comics I don't normally read the comments just summaries of stories I find on places like screen rant etc.,"So to my understanding respawn was created from the spliced DNA of Talia and Deathstroke to be the perfect supersoldier. but what would happen if there was more than two DNA donors?

Hypothetically speaking what if it was Superman. Wonder woman. Batman. Flash. Hawk girl and Ra's himself. Would he end up making an abomination with all of their spliced DNA or would he make respawn but with not all of the abilities from all of the DNA donors?

This has been on my mind ever since I started thinking about Superboy and how he is a clone of lex and Superman but earlier I saw a post about how Superboy doesn't seem to have the same intelligence as lex luthor? So. With the spliced DNA of multiple people would Respawn be an omnipotent being in a way or just an abomination with no point to exist?",DCcomics,0,0.27

Just going with the longer running of the two gives us  47, and I guess we can also count Academy for 15 issues because there was no other book coming out with it? And finally Taylor's run currently has 10, so that gives the total of 541.

If I Were to Restart the DC Cinematic Universe ,"Edit: a quick Google search has shown me that James Gunn is already doing a thing with this so this whole post is kind of moot.

Preface: I am not commenting on any of the movies, I am not offering opinions on any of that or anything that might start controversy; this is merely the musings of a madman, albeit, a madman that wishes to remain polite and courteous to their fellow redditors. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I am not up to date on the last ten years of comics and the last 5 years of DC movies. 

I digress.

If I were going to restart the DC films, I would open up with a Booster Gold movie. 

Why? 

He‚Äôs obscure enough that most casual fans don‚Äôt know who he is ‚Äî and I think that works to everyone‚Äôs artistic benefit. Less preconceived notions on the audience‚Äôs behalf going in. Some people might not even know he‚Äôs from
DC, without the branding. 

He has an amazing redemption arc in the form of Rip Hunter‚Äôs lackey in keeping the timeline secure.  Plus, his existence really makes it easy to lean into any of the 52/multiverse stuff if they wanted to. 

And, because his origin story leaves a pretty large opportunity to establish a cinematic franchise/the potential rosters of the JLA. 

For those not hip to BG: he‚Äôs from the future and a washed up jock working at a museum, until he steals a bunch of old superhero tech from the museum, travels into the past to modern times to establish an overly commercial identity as a superhero. Naturally, he does every bit of product placement you could imagine. The other heroes hate him for it ‚Äî but that‚Äôs also why he was chosen to help keep the timelime secure‚Ä¶ because nobody would suspect he would be trusted with such a responsibility. 

I dunno, I think it would be a really easy film to write and something that wouldn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. I‚Äôm sure someone else has pitched this before.

Girly Cassie or tomboyish Cassie? ,"
Lately I‚Äôve been reading myself a bit into some different young justice comics.

I stumbled upon that Cassandra sandsmarks/wonder girl had quiet the tomboyish look in the 90s comics.

"What is the best Green Lantern book to read, set prior to its Dawn of DC era? aka is it Grant Morrison's The Green Lantern?","So I've been plotting my return to comics via graphic novels regarding certain characters. And I have a system in place, sorta speak (more accidental), that involves getting a story(ies) that happened before the ""main point"". I know this makes no sense, so I'll try to explain in detail.

For Superman, it was Warworld; the epic saga that was the best Superman story in years, and it help guide me to his current era with the relaunch and Dawn of DC directive of Superman and Action Comics. For Batman, it was Joker War that sets up the current status quo of the character; for Wonder Woman, it was Trial of the Amazons, and for The Flash, the One Minute War.

For Green Lantern, its...well, thats the point of this topic.

I asked recently about Dark Crisis, and everyone said to skip it. Now part of the reason why I was curious about that event was its explanation toward Earth being quarantine, and its connection to Green Lantern with the Corps and Oa, etc. But the fact that its skippable means to just go into GL's Dawn of DC era with no issues, and after reading issue 1, I see alot has changed but easy to follow. 

Still, is there something else to get instead?

Looking at everything Green Lantern prior to Dark Crisis/Dawn of DC, I think the answer might be Grant Morrison's The Green Lantern. I don't recall any negative reactions toward his run, and my research is suggesting no issues that would affect me either. 

Question is: is his title the answer, or am I missing something? Another title that I missed or perhaps didn't think was important, but is the answer.

My Idea to justify why Batman doesn't kill the joker,"The fact that the joker still survive despite everything he has done is 

Gouvernment hates superheroes. They need them to deal with Big problems, sure. But they can't control them. A superhero like superman is seen a danger to the legitimity of the authority. There is also the fact their int√©rests almost always clashs . To simplify things, If superheroes in g√©n√©ral are neutral good, politicians are lawful neutral or lawful evil (the majority are lawful evil)

So the reason why military programs to take down superheroes and teams like the suicide squad exist. They just need a good reason  justify hunting down the classic super-heros and replace them with their american-sanctionned supers

With this. The question we need to Ask now is no longer ""why Batman doesn't kill the joker"" but ""why no one else including cops or the justice system is dealing with him"" ""why does he goes to an Asylum despite the fact he isn't crazy enough to benifice of the insanity plea ?"" 

The answer is simple: he's a bait. One day Batman will kill him which will be a good enough reason to hunt him down, stop him and/or kill him and replace him with superheroes 100% loyal to the american gouvernment. The kind that would Never disobey and Always follow orders .
The kind that would restore and maintain order in Gotham (in a incredibly fascist and corrupted way I mean)

More serious portrayal of Robin,"Good evening my gentlemans. I started watching Titans not that far ago and I will post my thoughts about it when I finish with the first season, but for now I have a single question. #Which Batman story portrays Robin so cool and serious simmilar to the one in the series? 

I  never thinked of Robin that way but as a funny iritating sidekick so this series was a nice suprise for me.  Don't get me wron , I have read ""3 Jokers"" as well   ""Court of Owls"" and both Nightwing and Red Hood were so well written, but I am talking about their Robin time in perticuialr.

"To me, the best Superman story of all time is Kingdom Come"," I remember first buying the hardcover edition which contained the whole series sometime in 1996 or 97 while I was on deployment in the Navy. Read it multiple times and it has stayed with me ever since.

And the reason why I think it's the best Superman story is because it didn't take the low hanging fruit approach, which is making Superman dark and edgy, or making him bewitched by red kryptonite or whatever.

Instead, Superman lost faith in society because society had lost faith in him. To me, this is profound. Superman's powers have always come not from the yellow sun, but by the people's faith in him that he would always do the right thing. He was the ideal we aspired to, even if we knew we never really could.

That loss of faith lead Superman to exile himself, and leave the world to its own fate. My reaction to that today is the same as it was back then: *Holy crap!*

Even back in the 90s, Superman was seen as a dinosaur with outdated morals and principals. Society wanted darker and grittier heroes who would kill bad guys on sight. They wanted more heroes like Batman and The Punisher (even though he's from Marvel).

The entire story was about how Superman and the classic members of the Justice League - including Batman! - gathered up all the new age superheroes and tried to show them what it meant to actually be a superhero. It was such an amazing story, and I don't really see writing like that today when it comes to Supes.

I have no idea what the new Superman movie will be about, but I sincerely hope at some point, someone tells a Superman story similar to that. Not just him saving the world from Zod or Darkseid, but grappling with an enemy more powerful than all of them: loss of hope.

Do something like that, and you can kindly STFU and take ALL my money.",DCcomics,24,0.75

A plot idea for a Mr. Freeze Solo Movie,"Inspired by some old posts I found on this sub-reddit and the less than optimistic response to my recent post on WB producing solo character driven movies for DC villains like Mr. Freeze, I decided to come up with a short plot of what a potential Mr. Freeze solo movie could be.

Let me know what you're all think:

In the heart of Gotham City, lived Victor Fries, a brilliant scientist whose life was forever altered by the warmth of love and the cold embrace of loss.

The movie begins with a glimpse into Victor's past, a time when he was not yet known as the notorious Mr. Freeze. In those early days, he was a man of science, devoted to his research and driven by a relentless curiosity about the world around him. But amidst the sterile confines of his laboratory, there was a spark of humanity that set him apart ‚Äì the love of his life, Nora.

Nora was unlike anyone Victor had ever known ‚Äì a beacon of light in his otherwise solitary existence. With her gentle smile and kind heart, she thawed the icy walls Victor had built around himself, bringing warmth and joy into his life. Their romance blossomed slowly, like a delicate flower unfurling its petals in the warmth of the sun.

As the movie unfolds, we witness the tender moments shared between Victor and Nora ‚Äì picnics in the park, late-night stargazing sessions, and stolen kisses in the moonlight. Their love is a force of nature, binding them together in a bond that transcends time and space.

But even the brightest flames are not immune to the chill of adversity, and tragedy soon strikes the young couple. Nora falls gravely ill, her once vibrant spirit dimmed by the specter of a deadly disease. As her condition worsens, Victor's world is plunged into darkness once more, his heart heavy with the weight of impending loss.

Determined to save the woman he loves, Victor throws himself into his work with renewed vigor, searching tirelessly for a cure to Nora's illness. Days turn into weeks, and weeks into months, but still, he refuses to give up hope. His laboratory becomes a sanctuary of sorts, a place where science and love intertwine in a desperate bid for salvation.

But fate is a cruel mistress, and despite Victor's best efforts, Nora's condition continues to deteriorate. As her life hangs in the balance, Victor is faced with an impossible choice ‚Äì to accept defeat or to defy the laws of nature itself. And so, with a heavy heart and a determined spirit, he embarks on a journey that will forever alter the course of his destiny.

The romantic part of the movie is not merely a subplot but the very heart and soul of the story, illuminating the depths of Victor and Nora's love and the lengths to which they will go to protect it. Theirs is a love story for the ages, a tale of passion, sacrifice, and redemption that will linger in the hearts of audiences long after the credits roll.

If WB could greenlight films such as "" Isn't it romantic"" , "" A Hollywood Christmas"" and "" Locked down"", I see no reason why they can't give this a serious consideration.

[other] Looking for a specific Green Lantern comic which i can't find anymore.,"When i started reading the green lantern i found myself reading a retelling of sorts of Hal Jordan. It told his origin story and how he became a lantern. Then, it was about a science guy who's head got blown out of proportions because of some alien tech, and Atrocitus (I believe, red demon like monster from the red lantern corpse who escaped) reaching earth. Sinestro (as Hal's mentor) and Hal were working together to piece it all together and fight Atrocitus.   


I remember needing to buy the next volume, lending out that specific run to friends of mine, but lost contact and forgot about it all. Now i want to get back into the green lantern and im REALLY trying to find this run but i cant for the life of me. Its not rebirth, i know it had something to do with secret files and origins i think, but its all very fuzzy.   


Hopefully some smart people on here can help me figure out what im talking about.",DCcomics,2,0.63

Basicaly Synder copied everything pretty much  on Justice League ,that is  one reason I hated it.

It is also one of this comercial film with the same silly script. Always the good guy vs the villains. That's tirering.

Some q's about YJ and KonCass,"So for the past week or so, I've spent a lot of time reading old serials of pre-flashpoint YJ and new 52 Teen titans, namely because of how Cassie and Conner (even Kon) are some of my favorite legacy characters (second only to the fab5). As such I have a few questions to ask. 1) Does Cassie remember the new52? I know Tim does. 2) Does no one remember Kon-El? Even Cassie? I mean she was kinda in a relationship with him.  Basically I don't get how Kon-El just randomly disappeared after all the adventures he had and how the titans just forgot about him, ik its something about harvest. 3) this is prob a common question but do you guys think we'll ever get KonCass again? I really wanna see them again and since Dawn of DC has been reviving lost relationships (DickBabs, HalCarol), can they also get revived? They haven't announced a dawn of DC YJ series yet although it makes sense why because of the Titans being the flag front. One more thinggg, have they announced a dawn of dc supergirl series because I am so confused on her origin story and if the thing about Zor-El being cyborg superman is still canon coz Zor-El got revived pre-flashpoint too.",DCcomics,0,0.33

(Getting back into Comics) Looking for some community recommendations and sign posting," I have always been a very casual comic hobbyist when I was last reading at the start of Rebirth. I am looking for some recommendations from the community, I know I can get some of the answers from Google, but am looking for some human experience and feedback. So if anyone could take the time to answer/give their opinion on one or more of my questions that would be fantastic.

Current and Historical reads:

Anything Superman(Inc. family stuff)

Constantine (Reading Marks of Woe, and the best version of you)

Injustice (Read all 5 years I believe)

Preacher (Book one TPB in post)

   
 Q1: I read roughly the first quarter of nearly everything DC Rebirth, but never experienced any of the big reveals. Do you think it's worth revisiting, if so is there a recommended order and set of TPB you can recommend?

Q2: What is the current continuity?  is it linked to Rebirth at all? Is the current line of books well-perceived and worth looking into?

Q3 My Missy watched the Sandman TV show without telling me or being aware it was comic adjacent and loved it. She has never read a comic in her life, and I have not read Sandman in the past (I'm aware my current read of Hellblazer is Sandman universe) is there a current line of Sandman TPB I can buy for her to enjoy? Happy for stories told in the TV show or not.

Q4: Appreciate this is not an exact science, but further recommendations for other books/lines my partner might enjoy if she enjoyed Sandman? (seems to like the concepts of the endless and Biblical stuff)

Q5: Swamp Thing have you read it and would you recommend it? would you start from the start or jump into a newer line (if it exists) TPB recommendations and general advice / pre-reading appreciated.

Q6: What is considered a hot comic line currently, wither you agree with it or not?

Q7: I seem to prefer the Vertigo, Black label lines( from my limited experience) can you recommend any books you personally love, can be any character and I will consider it for future reads.",DCcomics,3,0.67

Favorite Ending to Characters?,"The nature of comic books means that we will probably never see a definitive ending to the more popular DC characters. There have however been plenty of else worlds stories, alternate timelines, possible futures, and more that have given us endings to specific characters. Superman has a few, including Kingdom Come, All-Star Superman, Kal-L's ending, and my personal favorite, Superman: Secret Identity.

There's plenty of ones that are less talked about, and can be expanded in other stories in my opinion -- such as Earth 2 Batman raising his daughter as Huntress, or Orion ruling Apocalypse in Kingdom Come.",DCcomics,11,0.92

I Get The Feeling That Tom King Wanted To Write Superman or SuperSons Instead of Wonder Woman‚Ä¶,"I Get The Feeling That Tom King Wanted To Write A Superman or Supersons Book Instead Of Wonder Woman‚Ä¶

We‚Äôre almost 10 issues into the book and we‚Äôve seen more plot and characterization in the backup stories featuring Jon, Damien, &amp; Lizzie. 

Her villains were all taken out in less then 3 pages. WW herself has had zero character growth and seems slightly annoyed at best with the whole ‚ÄúNo Mo Amazons‚Äù thing going on. It doesn‚Äôt help that the main ‚Äúvillain‚Äù is narrating about how great she is and how badly he‚Äôs gonna lose. 

Instead of using her supporting cast, he seems much more enthusiastic about using Superman or Batman or their sons. Steve is a half-note, the Amazons are just a plot device, the gods are nonexistent and her sidekicks are just billboards at best.

Wonder Woman was in one issue during Tom‚Äôs Batman run. Superman and Batman have had their presence felt in nearly every issue whether in the background, through their progeny or them showing up in the comic period.

Tom King is a good writer but he clearly doesn‚Äôt want to write WW. He‚Äôs put 100% more effort in the backups and without the fantastic art, the run itself would be average at best.",DCcomics,0,0.37

[QUESTION] Newbie seeking advice on getting started with the current Batman/Superman &amp; Action/Detective Comics runs,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I really want to jump into the current Action Comics &amp; Detective Comics runs.¬†

For Detective Comics I have these issues:¬†1080,1081,1082,1083, haven‚Äôt read them yet. But it seems like there is too much catching up to do in order to get into these? Is there any point collecting issues after 1083 now or should I just resell them and wait until next arc, whenever it‚Äôs supposed to get started?¬†

For Action Comics I have the bizzaro story &amp; start of the house of brainiac that came out last week, so 1061,1062,1063,1064. Same question here, but at least here it seems like 3-issue arcs which is good and easy to jump in?

Lastly, I picked up the Worlds Finest 24,25 ‚Äî same question, enough to jump in or would need more context/better wait? Also, don't have any current Batman issues, but same question.

Has any adaptation of the Trigon arc matched up to Teen Titans (2003)?,"By matched up I don't necessarily mean being an accurate adaptation because Teen Titans season 4 certainly wasn't accurate to the comics. But rather how good it was in quality, enjoyment, and its own spin on the ideas of the original story.

I ask because there are two Titans stories that are frequently adapted and retold again and again: The Terror of Trigon and The Judas Contract. Teen Titans 2003 did an adaptation of the latter in its second season and I certainly enjoyed it. However there's a decent bit about the Judas Contract animated movie from the DCAMU that actually have me putting it above the 2003 version and I could make a reasonable argument in its favor.

But by contrast, no adaptation I've ever seen of the Trigon arc even comes close to matching 2003's version, let alone surpassing it. While not perfect because nothing is it did a damn good job with the material and got me invested and caring about the characters and story. I'm curious if others feel the same or if you have an argument to make for other Trigon adaptions, be they Titans, the DCAMU, or some other version I'm overlooking.",DCcomics,1,0.56

Powers for batfam,"What powers would you give the members of the batfamily for example.


Batman: the ability to concentrate on multiple things at the same time allowing him to achieve true multitasking.


Nightwing: empathetic six sense basically letting him sense people‚Äôs emotions. Maybe the ability to jump a bit higher than a normal person to.


Batgirl: technopath let her speak to computers making her the ultimate woman in the chair when she becomes oracle.


Red hood: the ability to see the path projectiles will take letting him avoid gun fire better and eventually aim guns more accurately. Also maybe a very slow healing factor after he becomes red hood.


Damian: the ability to perfectly copy any move he sees another person perform like taskmaster does, also explains how he‚Äôs so good at everything as a child.

Need help with Teen Titans,"Heya!

I've recently gotten back my interest in DC comics and their animated shows, particularly the Teen Titans.

From what I know, there's the original Teen Titans, Go!, Young Justice and Titans (LA) correct? Is there any I should watch specifically or which do you think I'd enjoy the most?

Also, in terms of comics, is there any chronological order for them that I can find online or what/which comics do you recommend I start with and follow through with?

I'm trying to remember a comic I read as a kid and need a little help identifying it. Here are the details I remember:

* I remember a scene where this superhero tries to save someone who is being hanged by cutting a rope. 
* Batman and Wonder Woman are involved in a subplot where they are trying to interrogate a criminal. 
* The criminal mentions something about a sailor's knot in relation to the crime they are investigating. 
* There is also a connection to Louis Lane at the end of the comic.

Who would you approach to train you if you were a normal human like Bruce?,"I've recently read Batman: The Knight and really enjoyed it. It had me wondering, if in the current continuity, someone else decided to follow in Bruce and Anton's footsteps, who would they approach to train them? 

With all of the Heroes and Villains running rampant, they would be spoilt for choice, as long as they can convince them to train them that is.

I doubt the League of Assasins just takes in anyone, so you would have to get someone else to train you first. The Ashram that trained Connor Hawke seems to be a good bet considering they took in a child. Also, Master Kirigi assuming he's taking on new students after the rest of his got slaughtered. Maybe once someone's got that level of training, Deathstroke might consider taking them as an apprentice, after all, he seemed to have a fixation on Robin joining him.

[Discussion] Justice League: Doom ruins the nuance of it's source material (Spoiler for both the Movie and Comic),"Warning: Really Long Post

The 2012 animated movie Justice League: Doom is an adaptation of Mark Waid's miniseries JLA: Tower of Babel, and the most iconic part of that story is the reveal that Batman has a contingency plan for taking down the league if they were to ever go rouge, which has become a staple for online 'who would win' Battleboard discussions. But despite the 2012 adaptation being an alright flick, the one thing it does wrong is the discussion on whether what batman did was right or wrong. I make this post because I just recently read the comic and  while it's not perfect, I felt the comic had a better more nuance take on the contingency plan than the movie.

In the comic book, every character has their own reason for deciding whether or not Batman stays on the team. Martian Manhunter had his own files on earths superheroes in case he ever found himself needing to defend himself and 'defend' is the key word since he was all alone on the planet and had no idea who he can trust, offense was never something he intended, and even then he still regrets making those plans and being so distrustful. Because of all that he decided Batman should stay because even if he finds what Batman did as bad, he feels he would be a hypocrite if he voted to kick him out. The Flash (Wally West in the comic) voted on Batman staying because he felt that while he's furious at Bruce, he's seen the incident where villains swapped bodies with members of the justice league, hell he's seen the reverse flash and the damage that he's capable of , after all the yellow prick killed his aunt, so he felt Batman had a point in being prepared for the worst. The same went for Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner) He literally has the last ring in existence because Hal Jordan went crazy killed all the other lanterns and became a villain, yeah he didn't like batman for what he did, but he is 100% willing to see where he comes from he even understood not telling them. We never saw how Superman voted but It's implied that he voted for Batman to stay. Superman totally gets it.

On the other hand you have Aquaman who believes that they've all earned the trust of the world and at the very least should have trust for each other thus voting against Batman. There's also Plastic Man who was still bitter about nearly being shattered into a million pieces and possibly dying which caused him to vote against Batman even if Batman was the only reason he was on the League but hey, that's what trauma can do to you. Lastly was Wonder Woman who completely believed that Batman didn't intend to abuse these plan nor let them get out, but she couldn't work on a team with someone that she and everyone else knows is actively analyzing all of their weaknesses to disable them even during casual conversation. Knowing that his presence would weaken the league instead of strengthening them, she sadly voted him out. As for Bruce? He left before the voting could even end knowing that him being on the team was going to be a hindrance and that he should have been more trusting of his team.

With all of that in mind, how did the film handle this part? By making every league member as one dimensional and as stupid as they could get away with. Every single member with the exception of Superman was simply too stupid to comprehend why these plans would and should exist and were mad at the existence of such plans, not the breach of trust. Not only that but instead of Batman waiting outside for his fate to be decided by the league before leaving shamefully as to not get in their way later down the line, now he was part of the conversation completely unrepentant and literally calls them all idiots, which in fairness they are but only because the film goes out of it's to make them all so, before leaving the league because apparently they weren't good enough for him.

It basically started the idea that the league is mad about the plans when that was quite literally never the issue and goes out of its way to paint any league member with powers as a short sided idiot for the sake of justifying the plans, loosing all the complex debate from the comics. There other issues I do have with both mediums like the flaws in the plans themselves and how Batman was careless enough to have be stolen, TWICE, but for now I'll can just dismiss as comic book logic so the story could work.",DCcomics,52,0.82

[Discussion] Anybody else tired of Donna troy‚Äôs disastrous love life?,"Art: By george perez

Let‚Äôs get this out the way writers genuinely need to stop shipping her with characters until she gets some good stories and more character foundation outside of the titans. 

But anyways it‚Äôs a shame most of her stories revolve around her love life ( and getting erased from existence and getting her entire life retconned to an annoying degree) and how her relationships kinda just suck.

First we have Terry Long who of course is a marv wolfmans self insert (Yuck) who is also her 30 something college professor that started dating her when she was a 18 year old freshman. (double yuck). Now this would‚Äôve been a lot less weird if they just didnt have him act like a total creep half the time. Like referring to the titans as kids (same age as donna btw) while simultaneously flirting with all the girls in the team. And of course they got married had a kid together and divorced because Terry started to feel insecure and started blaming all of his life‚Äôs problems on Donna being a hero. Now the whole being a divorced mom juggling being a superhero would‚Äôve been an interesting for Donna if terry and their kid didn‚Äôt get fucking annihilated.

Then we got Roy and there relationship is very‚Ä¶eh‚Ä¶in my opinion I know it gets a lot of praise because of Donna being a mother figure to Lian and them having a lot of history from dating and being on the same team when they were teenagers. But honestly I think most of the praise is just from him not being terry. My main problem with Roy and Donna‚Äôs relationship is how they never had a moment that didn‚Äôt involve baby mamma drama, Divorce,Dead/crazy ex lovers or Donna being brought from the dead and having an extensional crisis. 

Like there was barely any genuine moments where their shitty lives weren‚Äôt constantly brought up and at best they were just fuck buddies. First because of Donna‚Äôs divorce and then they were kinda sorting dating/fuck buddies again when she was brought back from the dead but this time Roy was catching feelings but Donna thought he was a total fucking loser (she told him this to his face btw) and wanted to see if she had free will via dating him because she was brought back from wally‚Äôs memories of her being perfect. And when she broke things off she didn‚Äôt really give a shit about Roy‚Äôs feelings she was only afraid of Lian becoming too attached to her.

Another problem is just Roy just constantly being a man whore like there were some old titans silver age panels were teenage Roy would hit on chicks in front of Donna during their dates and one panel where it was implied they broke up because he hit on her roommate. Which I wouldn‚Äôt put past him in those days. And then the whole fuck buddies arc thing where Roy was constantly fucking anything with a pulse (tried to fuck a mermaid while his daughter was there btw) and Donna was just kinda having a dry spell I guess.

Help me decide where should I start from,"First of all I have choosen some characters and/or series I want to get into, but I'm not sure if I can read some of the series without previous knowledge and which series should I start to read about a character.

- Batman/Joker (I have read some already, I'm interested on any good series starring any of them). The ones I'm currently interested in:
    - Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious Earth
    - Batman: White knight
    - Joker (Brian Azzarello)
    - Batman: The long halloween
- The sandman: I loved every Neil Gaiman job I consumed. I also think this has his own shared universe, but I'm not sure tho
- Watchmen: I don't know anything about, but many people told me those are good
- Hellboy: I liked the movies, not sure if they are faithful to the comic tho. Someone recomended me to read the ones made by Mike Mignola
- Teen titans: I liked the cartoon, I might enjoy the comics too
- Doom patrol: I watched the show and I liked some plots/ideas, not sure if the comics are worth reading
- Swamp thing (Alan Moore): Can I read those comics without earlier issues about the character? (I like Alan Moore)

Who is the Roman Reigns of DC comics?,"Roman Reigns is a pro wrestler who was hyped up as the next big superstar by the WWE, but was widely hated by fans until very recently despite being billed as their greatest star.

Why can't WB/DC give other villains the Joker Treatment on the Big Screen?,"I'm writing this after watching the new Joker 2 trailer for the 5th time and seeing how much excitement that little teaser has garnered, amongst nerds and non hardcore fans alike. By delving into the backgrounds and motivations of iconic villains like Mr. Freeze, Lex Luthor, or Death strike, Death shot, Hugo Strange, Victor Szasz and many other lesser known villains, WB/DC stand the chance to win new audiences, as these movies explore the humanity and the motivations that drove these characters into villainy. A rarely explore theme in the Comic book movie genre.

These films offer a fresh perspective, allowing viewers to empathize with characters traditionally portrayed as antagonists. Moreover, it opens up storytelling opportunities for unique narratives and anti-hero arcs. Following the MCU fatigue, people are looking for depth and nuance in the movies they choose to support

The success of villain-centric movies(as proven by the reception to the Joker movies) have the potential to diversify the studio's revenue streams, reducing dependence on traditional hero-centric narratives. Additionally, merchandise sales, streaming rights, and potential spin-offs could further boost profits, creating a lucrative new avenue for revenue generation for DC. DCEU might have lost the war for the heroes, but we could definitely win it for the villains.

Addendum: We've had blockbuster trilogies from less known comic characters like Guardians of the Galaxy, Venom and Ant-man. So being lesser known is obviously no longer a good reason for WB to fail once again at capitalising on these great opportunities.

I already change something like the time Cosmic Raptor come, Imperiex-Prime(Thinking if I should add him to come with Cosmic Raptor or being create later)¬†

Any suggestion for something to remove/add/change is very appreciated.

**Before creation**

- Before Creation, it was said that there was only a Great Darkness; a single black infinitude where nothing and everything were the same thing. From the darkness came a burning light. As the light grew, everything was no longer nothing and the darkness screamed, causing an imperceptible flaw in what was once the immaculate perfection of the light. With the birth of the Source from the dark, forces danced with each other like threads on destiny's loom, giving birth to the Lords of Chaos and the Lords of Order.

- The Source of All Things created the Hands to populate the Void with Multiverses using Anti-Crisis Energy. After creating their Multiverse, each Hand would return their energies to the Source. However, one rogue, named Perpetua, refused her fate and desired a vicious reality of eternal crisis and rebirth.

- God (aka YHWH/‚ÄúThe Presence‚Äù/ The Voice/ The Hand/ The Source) creates a companion for himself. After a dispute, that companion is cast down to the realm that will later be Hell, becoming known as ‚ÄúThe First of the Fallen.‚Äù God replaces him by creating the angelic host.

**Dawn of Time (20 billion BCE)**

- Some time before Perpetua created the first Multiverse, the Great Darkness spawned a ""daughter"" in the Void and entrusted her to ""the Shadows"" of a subsection of the Void called The Dark Garden.

- The Source, from which sprung forth an explosion of incalculable energies that heralded the Dawn of Time. Manipulating this newborn multiverse was Perpetua, who entrusted its three realms of matter, anti-matter and dark matter to her sons. As the cosmos slowly expanded and gave rise to stars and planets.

- Destiny, first of The Endless is born and recorded all that transpired in his book.

- Hecate born inside other plane which will become Sphere of gods

**18 Billion Years ago**

- The original GodWorld forms also known as Asgard or Urgrund. (Inside plane which will become Sphere of gods)

**17 Billion Years ago**

- Other Life appears on the GodWorld (the ‚ÄúSecond World‚Äù).

- Death and Dream of the Endless born

**15 Billion Years ago**

- Perpetua called upon Mar Novu to show him her greatest creation. Perpetua had searched the endless worlds of the Multiverse looking for the perfect creation, but could not find it. Disappointed in what saw, Perpetua bound the Martians with the Humans, creating the Apex Predators; perfect killing machines that would live and fight until the end of time. Upon seeing what his mother had created, Mar Novu told her that he found a cosmic judgement coming for them because of her actions and that she was well aware of that and wished to fight back. Perpetua then tried to share her point of view in vain, leading her to order her Apexes to attack Novu, forcing him to flee.

- Humanoid lifeforms on Urgrund attained godhood, thus becoming the Old Gods. First among the Old Gods was Olgrun.

**13.8**¬†**Billion Years ago**

- Mar Novu told his brothers what he had seen and they agreed that her kinds, the Hands needed to be alerted of her doings. They were interrupted by Perpetua who witnessed their betrayals and sent her Apex Predators to attack her sons.

- The Hands's response was to send the Cosmic Raptor to stop Perpetua's plan. Unable to defeat the Cosmic Raptor, Perpetua, her Apex Predators and the totality of her power were taken to the Source Wall and imprisoned in it. The Hands recreated Perpetua's Multiverse, allowing the Multiverse to evolve without intrusion. Perpetua was trapped and forced to watch it all.

- Imperiex-Prime is created to repeatedly destroyed the universe to create a new one from the ashes of the old.

- After the recreation of the Multiverse, the story of Perpetua was hidden by Krona and the other Maltusians who gathered all evidence.

- A race of beings called Aurakles emerge from the Source at the beginning of creation. In time the race spawns one individual who is fascinated by the lives of organic beings. A sentimental Aurakle witness the death of Violet Harper and unwittingly reaches out to her. It is then forever trapped in her body.

- Rallying a third of the Angels to his side, Lucifer the Morningstar began a War in Heaven against his brother, the Archangel Michael, who defeated Lucifer's forces and cast them down into Hell, where they were reborn as demons. One of the fallen angels begged forgiveness and was transformed by Michael into the Wrath of God, the instrument of divine vengeance. Another angel, who refused to fight for either side, was cast out by Heaven and Hell, condemned to walk Earth alone for the rest of eternity, a stranger to all.

- Destruction of The Endless is born; his sword is created. Delight, last of the Endless, follows after him.

- On Cilia, the Lords of Order manifest themselves as the first sentient race in the universe, a race of energy beings. Presumably, the Lords of Chaos follow suit.

**10 Billion years ago**

- Humanoid life appears on planet Maltus. Maltusian myth tells of a Triarch born then: Tzodar the Destroyer, Quarra the Cultivator, &amp; Archor the Grower. They turn on their father, the great god Daalon, then abandon Maltus, scattering to far corners of universe, one day returning to level Maltus &amp; any who live on it. (The Triarch did not really exist at this time.) Legends of Triarch will inspire a Controller to create his own Triarch millions of years later

- A non-organic race called the Kregors create functioning brains from biological material. They use the brains as power sources.

- Volthoom discovered the Maltusian species on the planet Maltus. These Maltusians were an incredibly intelligent species who sought to learn the secrets of the spectrum. The Maltusians planned to pour all of their emotions into a new battery they called the Great Heart, as they believed losing their emotions would lead to greater discoveries. Upon successfully completing the ritual, a power ring emerged from the center of the Great Heart. Volthoom slipped this ring on and became the First Lantern in the Multiverse.

- Krona, a Maltusan, built a machine to discover the secrets of the very creation of the Universe. He watched through his portal a gigantic palm with a broth of stars in his hand as the machine exploded.

- Driven by guilt over Krona's actions the Maltusans created Manhunters which they then replaced with the Green Lantern Corps. However, due to differences on how to deal with the evil created by Krona the Maltusans split into the Guardians of the Universe and Controllers.

- he spectrum began to affect the mental health of Volthoom, ultimately leading to his insanity and an attempt to kill the Maltusians.

- In order to secure their inventions, the Maltusians destroyed his Travel Lantern, thus trapping Volthoom in the Prime Earth universe. After killing thousands of Maltusians as a form of revenge, Volthoom was defeated by the seven ""Proto-Green Lanterns"", the Great Heart ripped from his chest, and the first Power Ring taken away. Soon after, the Guardians imprisoned Volthoom in an unbreakable chamber (known as the Chamber of Shadows), and wrote him out of their history. A number of Maltusians (now named 'Guardians') remained behind to ensure that the First Lantern was kept imprisoned and became known as The Hidden Ones.

- Olgrun fell to madness and murdered his own daughter in his rage. The other Old Gods warred against him for an age and eventually defeated him, but were unable to kill him. They split his essence into seven ""aspects"" which they scattered across the Multiverse

- Without Olgrun, Urgrund fell into war. At the heart of this conflict was Lokee, god of mischief and bastard son of the chief god Wotan, who became the first god of evil. The conflict between the forces of good and evil escalated until Ragnarok came that saw GodWorld being torn asunder in a great explosion where the gods perished.

- One of the weapons used in the titanic conflict of the Old Gods, Mageddon the Anti-Sun, is imprisoned in a gravity sink on the outer curve of spacetime.

**5 Billion years ago**

- Apokolips &amp; New Genesis form inside the plane later know as Sphere of the Gods. 700,000,000 after that Life begins on Apokolips and New Genesis.

- The Earth coalesces from cosmic dust.

- The demons Abnegezar, Rath, and Ghast reign over the Earth, until banished by the Timeless Ones.

- Vanishing Point is created by the Linear Men, located in Limbo ‚Äî at the heart of the Source.

**3 Billion years ago**

- After defeating the demons of the Empire of Tears on the planet Ysmault, the Guardians of the Universe attempt to banish sorcery from the cosmos by gathering together the universe's magical energies into a single mass called the Starheart.

- Massacre of Sector 666

- King Kull was the ruler of a race of protohumans known as the Submen, a race which ruled the Homo Sapiens until eventually overthrown in a revolt. As a result, Kull locked himself in a state of suspended animation.

- The Oan race splits along gender lines. The females become known as the Zamarons and leave Oa. They temporarily settle on the planet Korugar as its rulers.

**1 Billion years ago**

- The dark dreams of a cosmic entity give rise to a new dimension called Darkworld. Certain godlike beings were created along with it: Chief among these beings were Weaver, guardian &amp; master of multi-colored threads of magical energy; Chaon, twisted god of evil &amp; chaos; Gemimn, goddess of order; Tynan, cosmic balancer of order &amp; chaos; Deedra, goddess of nature; and Jheryl, goddess of truth &amp; knowledge.

- A race of shaggy blue-furred humanoids on the planet Rann banish the evil scientist and would-be tyrant Carlon Zan into space. A time-warp transports Zan to the present day and transforms him into a radioactive menace.

- The Xan, a race of humans from another planet, establish a super-civilization on Earth, living in celestial cities built by advanced science. As a specialized builder of robots and androids, his greatest achievement is Eternal, a giant half-robot, half-android built to live forever, energized by cosmic radiation, and given the full knowledge of the Xan in his artificial brain. Incredibly wise and powerful, Eternal planned to conquer Earth for himself. Before he could do so, a cloud of space gas hit Earth, gas the Xan knew could kill them. Eternal traveled to the Earth's core to find Absorbium, the only element that could counter space gas, but the absorbium caused Eternal to be paralyzed for one billion years.",DCcomics,0,0.33

Raven and Kid Flash after The terror of Trigon New Teen Titans arc,"I just finished reading from the start of The new teen titans all the way through the Terror of Trigon(New Teen Titans volume 2 issue 5) and have a few questions as this was where I planned to jump off the series and back to my Batfamily post-crisis reading.

I was hoping there would be an epilogue in the following issue but the storyline is moving back to Lilliths origins so I have a couple of questions that can hopefully help me tie a few loose ends.

For Raven is there a specific issue where she returns to the team. I was just hoping to get some closure on her arc but it ends abruptly with her disappearing.

For Wally is there an issue in teen titans or the flash where he gets his powers back and they are no longer killing him?

I was mainly reading for the Robin to Nightwing arc for Dick Grayson but got invested and decided to at least continue until The hive, Slade and Trigon were completed. I feel I was able to do that outside of those two points for Raven and Wally.",DCcomics,2,0.6

Additional Robin ,"My kind of sad idea, regarding Nightwing and Red Hood. We all know that first kid of Bruce was Dick, he was very young and all. Once he was enrolled into the private school after Bruce adopted him, he was kind of bullied but didn't told it either to Bruce or Alfred, because he was still recovering from loss of his parents, but there was one kid who was always protecting him from bullies in school. Later Dick came to the information that his saviour from the bullies was also an orphan (kid of teenage couple who decided to let go of him), but since he was very talented in science he did revived a scholarship to the prestige school (the one that Dick was in). And since he was few years older than him he was kind of big brother figure for Dick. It didn't took long for Dick to invite his brother figure (let's name him Michael)to the mansion, since he was only one who was nice to him. It didn't took Alfred more than a second to see what was Dick planning, which is convincing Bruce to adopt Michael. I took some time but with combined Dicks and Alfred convincing him, he did it. Michael was teenager at the time he was adopted by Bruce and was in heaven, first because someone did adopted him at least, second he really did liked Dick, and last well living in Wayne mansion can't be that bad for a teenager. Of course after sometime he did figured out about Batman and Robin. One night when Batman and Robin where on a patrol he just figured out the combination on the piano and walk right into the batcave. Of course Bruce wasn't very happy with that, but decided to give him a chance. Bruce did few simulations on Michael and he was shocked how good he was. It didn't took much time until Michael could go with Batman on the patrols. Of course there was an issue with two Robins at one time but they quickly figured it out by giving Michael his own superhero name The Knight, Michael choose it by himself, of course Lucius created new suit for him. Micheal was more that happy to help Batman, and since he was his own superhero he did tried to go by himself, failed few times but was successful most of it. There were of course ups and downs in the story, but Michael never did turned his back on Dick, always was big brother to him. When came the time came when Dick changed from Robin to Nightwing, everyone understud Dicks motives. Not long after Nightwing moved to Bludhaven, The Knight was working on the huge case of human trafficking, he did asked Bruce if he can go on his own to the South America to end it, Bruce wasn't against it, he was even happy that Michael wanted to do something by himself and he did trusted him to bring the organisation to the justice. After few months of being in South America Michael returned to Gotham successful. Then he noticed that there is yet another Robin. He wasn't happy with that idea because he knew exactly what is the price of it, and he did told it to Bruce, there was a huge fight between them about it, but then Michael saw Jason, and he turned from anger to compassion. Michael and Jason really quickly liked eachother, Michael did a lot of training with Jason, and he did appreciate it, it came to the point where Bruce let Michael take Jason on patrol by themselves. Michael was really great big brother figure for Jason but he didn't forget about Dick. There were time that only three of them went for a patrol, Alfred of course had to convince Bruce for the whole day to allow that, but there were ""only brothers patrols"". Of course we know how it goes with Jason. In this he's killed at the time when Dick and Michael fight the crime ring in Bludhaven together, of course they hear the news form Gotham that Robin was killed by The Joker. Micheal was so angry at that that he took off and went straight for The Joker, he did had Joker on his knees laughing, Michael wanted and almost took the last swing at joker but was stopped by Batman, Micheal and Bruce looked into eachother eyes and Bruce knew he lost one more son today. Their relationship was never the same, Michael almost never visited Wayne mansion, and when he did was only speaking with Alfred. Of course after sometime there was a Red Hood incident in Gotham. Not long after they did figured out that Red Hood is resurrected Jason, and when there was a fight between Red Hood and Joker, Michael did interviewed, kicking Red Hood aside but leaving himself vulnerable to Joker, Michael took off his mask, looked at Jason, said ""I'm sorry kid"", and smiled very warmly before Joker shoot him in the head. 
After that Bruce did had enough of Jokers, and everyone did assumed he was going to kill him, but now it was Jason who stopped him, telling him that Michael wouldn't want that.
The Justice League don't know about Michael (The Knight) because Bruce doesn't like to talk about that. Jason did became darker and more distance from everyone. And Dick, he like always hide his pain behind humour.
They never brought Michael again apart from his birthday, then Bruce, Dick, Jason and Alfred just sat together and told a stories of creative pranks he pulled on them.",DCcomics,0,0.31
Who are the top ten richest people on the current Earth?,"I was wondering who the richest people in the current DC continuity are, on Earth. There are a number of Company Owners like Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne, but do any others compare to the likes of LexCorp and Wayne Industries?

I imagine if anyone would be close it would be Stagg Industries, currently belonging to both Sapphire and Sebastian Stagg. But do they even compare? Theres also Ted Kord, Oliver Queen, Maxwell Lord and Michael Holt with Terrifitech etc. Do any of these go anywhere near Bruce and Lex levels?

Vandal Savage, and Ra‚Äôs Al Ghul may have immense levels of wealth from being alive for so long. Both probably either similar or greater to Lex and Bruce.

Aquaman and Black Adam could make the list both owning their own countries, however I‚Äôm not sure how wealthy Khandaq is.

Who do you guys think the top ten are?

clones of Roy Harper. (questions regarding them),"Im on season 3 of Young Justice, and there are currently two clones of Roy Harper, if im counting right. the first Roy Harper, the original that was abducted right after becoming Speedy and kept inside of a tube, the second Roy Harper-the main one that we see through out Young Justice, the first clone, and the third one, some.. random Cop? maybe it was late at night or something but i did not get how there were 3 roys in one place, when did the third Roy come into play? thats my first question. the second being, is this whole Roy clone thing canon to the comics? does it play a big role? do all the roys have different lives? do they interact at all? are all Roys parental figures to Lian? And i think my most important question to which i couldnt find the answer to anywhere for some reason- which Roy is the Roy we see in ""Redhood and the outlaws"" ? some of these questions might be dumb, but i hope someone will answer them, because i am real lost, and am considering reading some of Speedy's comics, but wanted to get a good idea of what if happening with all the clones before i jump in",DCcomics,2,0.59

How is it that Constantine is always able to outsmart his way with demonic entities? Can he do the same with any higher level beings?,"Like, they're supposed to be beings that have a higher level of understanding than us yet every time Constantine shows up, he somehow can get away by talking his way out as if he have some sort of anomalous amounts of either wisdom or charisma. Not to mention he does the same with Lucifer. Why does this happen, does he actually have a some sort of blessing, talent, mad IQ, or is he just written like that and the writers just nerfs the intelligence of these beings? If it's a written thing, for what purpose is he written like that? Like how superman is written to show hope, justice, the American way, what is Constantine supposed to represent, the wits and resilience of a human being? Can he do the same with all deities or just demons in particular? Because it would be madly insane yet impressive if he can somehow outsmart the big G aka God Himself.",DCcomics,2,0.57
"Let's discuss ""The Long Halloween"" ending, who's actually the Holiday Killer?","Note: lots of spoilers, don't read this post if you haven't read the comic

I just finished reading ""The Long Halloween"" for the second time, and I'm equally puzzled and intrigued by the ending as I was the first time. Everything more or less makes sense until that strange and confusing conclusion. Who is the holiday killer? How many holiday killers are there in total?

One of the theories, and probably the most plausible one, is that we have 2 holiday killers: the first one being Gilda Dent and the second one Alberto Falcone, who continues where Gilda left off. There's no reason to doubt Gilda's confession when she sets fire to Holiday's remains while thinking out loud. So, I believe she actually did commit the murders up until New Year's, wanting to free Harvey from his job and protect the family. This would mean that Gilda killed Johnny Viti, the Irish gang, (although it's debatable how likely it is for one woman to kill a group of mobsters, but in comic logic, I guess it's possible), and Milos, Falcone's bodyguard.

Alberto takes on the role of Holiday after faking his death on New Year's, but that part is somewhat unclear to me. It would take a lot of coincidences for Alberto to pick up where Gilda left off without any agreement or cooperation. But let's chalk up that inconsistency to comic logic as well. 

Throughout the story, Dent's role is the most unclear to me. He claims there are two holiday killers, which is probably the case, but we don't know if he's referring to himself as one of them (as Batman assumes) or to Alberto and his wife. Does Harvey even know that his wife is Holiday? And if we were to include Harvey's killings as part of the ""Holiday killer"" murders, then would we have three holiday killers?

However, I believe Harvey is not the holiday killer; his two murders are solely the result of personal vendettas that happened to coincide on holidays. Gilda still believes Harvey is the second killer, though, while in her logic, Alberto is just a scapegoat taking responsibility for reasons known to him.

The story is quite complicated, and I honestly think the authors got a bit lost in the narrative, making it overly convoluted to the point of creating too many plot holes/leaps, and there isn't a perfectly logical explanation. So, all we're left with is to develop our own theories about what exactly happened and who the killers are. I choose the variant where the killers are Gilda and Alberto, while Harvey only turns evil after becoming Two-Face, i.e., after the accident (although it could be argued that his malice started much earlier, given he knew about his wife's murders) ",DCcomics,47,0.82

I'm a Sentry fan, surprise, and I honestly believe both versions had promise if one writer would have bold enough to explore the reality of them way more than the few issues they shown up respectively.

* Death Seed Sentry was basically Sentry without the Void AKA full potential mode. Stable and ""healthy"". Strong enough to hold 50% of the weight of Exitar, the celestial executioner and move it's corpse away from earth.
* Merged Sentry was....we actually don't know as it seemed like he constantly battles with the Void inside when IMO it supposed to be a version where there is no more Sentry or Void or Robert as separate entities.

Would you guys accept newsprint if it meant cheaper and bigger comics?,"So I think one thing we all agree on is that sometimes comics can be a bit on the expensive side. Especially if you want to follow an entire line of books like the X-Men. Which makes sense considering the quality of the paper they're printed on. 

But let's ask a hypothetical. If Marvel switched back to newsprint paper, which is relatively cheaper to print, about 48 pages per issue, and price at about $1.99 USD, would you guys be down for it?

I would be. I think each individual issue being twice as big can help with some of the pacing issues some modern comics have. And producing it on cheaper paper would help keep the cost of each issue reasonable. 

Plus, with comics being priced at two dollars an issue, that's 10 comics for just $20. You can't tell me that's not a good deal.

My headcanon is that Cap‚Äôs off with Falcon looking for Bucky at the moment, Captain Marvel is off with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor is M.I.A after Ragnarok so Jane is currently wielding Mjolnir.

There has been a few characters who have had a bad live action showing. Now I'm a huge Dr Doom fan, and that was bad, but at least he had a pretty good mask.

But Apocalypse... what in the blue blazing hell was that!!! If you were to put that movie on mute, would you even know who the hell that was. EVERYONE ELSE looks relatively comic accurate. They looked different but I new who Archangel was. Nightcrawler is a tricky character to bring to live action but they got it done. Unless you know X Men lore you wouldn't get the pyramid thing.

"Eric the Red, aka the Kang Hunter. ","In an alternate timeline Thor Odinson and Wanda Maximoff, aka The Scarlet Witch, were lovers and had a child named Eric Thorson with fiery red hair and a mischievous glint in his eye. 

Shortly after Eric's birth his parents were killed by a version of Kang the Conqueror but the boy was saved by his Uncle Loki. 

Loki with the help of the Enchantress raised Eric with the idea of revenge. How better to take revenge against Kang and his well ordered timeline than to introduce a new god of chaos? 

Learning how to use his vast potential from his Uncle Loki and growing up under the watchful gaze and doting attentions of the Enchantress, Eric grew to usurp Chthon and claim the title god of chaos. 

It was after that victory that Kang fearing him simply weeded that entire timeline out of existence. 

Eric barely managed to escape to the 616 timeline, where he is significantly less powerful but just as hateful towards every version of Kang and any tyrant who would impose a strict order over others. 

Now under the name Eric the Red a new hero has causing disasters for the plans of would be oppressors and sowing the seeds of chaos and freedom to rebuild his power and hunt his prey.

Anyway:  this subreddit is awesome!!! Thanks again from the bottom of my klutz-at-technology heart!!!


(Original post)

I have been trying to read the comics on marvel unlimited since getting the subscription last week, but somehow every day it gets harder to find ANY comics when I search for them. This includes comics I started reading the day before and wanted to finish.

I have been trying to search for Excalibur 1988 #1, to finish reading it, but it‚Äôs gone.  I can find the current series 2019, which gives me individual issues for pages instead of just showing me a list of issues; but then the search starts giving me wolverine issues. Worse, it floods the search with articles, videos, etc, instead of just giving me the comics.

I got this subscription so I can catch up on the comics from the start, the whole story, and follow along with various x-men podcasts like a good little nerd; but instead of being a normal database of comics - like a library, if you will - it‚Äôs as if it‚Äôs designed by someone who HATES having to share the information.

If people are paying for a service you‚Äôre offering, access to your content, once we‚Äôre in you need to let us read the content. It‚Äôs fine, you already have the money, and if you want more you need to let the content work its magic. It‚Äôs digital content, so reading it won‚Äôt leave grubby finger marks on the digital pages.

Marvel: please make it easier to find the issues so I can read them. Whatever is going on in your current design is just making me resentful and want to quit. ‚ÄúRage quit‚Äù is not going to lead to me buying anything later. I want to be so invested in the content I end up buying replica magneto helmets and nightcrawler socks and other stuff, but I can‚Äôt get there if the bad website design stays this bad and I give up in frustration instead of engaging in commerce with your business.",Marvel,9,0.67

Is Marvel Unlimited disorganized on purpose???,"EDIT:  a huge THANK YOU to everyone who helped me with the baby steps to figuring this out.  I was playing with the browser and typed the comics/series, and it took me to a simple alphabetical list of series, which then had the issues albeit with the first issues at the very end. The site can use instructions for people like me, who don‚Äôt have people who can teach them in real life. There‚Äôs lots out there, and comics are for everyone.

Anyway:  this subreddit is awesome!!! Thanks again from the bottom of my klutz-at-technology heart!!!


(Original post)

I have been trying to read the comics on marvel unlimited since getting the subscription last week, but somehow every day it gets harder to find ANY comics when I search for them. This includes comics I started reading the day before and wanted to finish.

I have been trying to search for Excalibur 1988 #1, to finish reading it, but it‚Äôs gone.  I can find the current series 2019, which gives me individual issues for pages instead of just showing me a list of issues; but then the search starts giving me wolverine issues. Worse, it floods the search with articles, videos, etc, instead of just giving me the comics.

I got this subscription so I can catch up on the comics from the start, the whole story, and follow along with various x-men podcasts like a good little nerd; but instead of being a normal database of comics - like a library, if you will - it‚Äôs as if it‚Äôs designed by someone who HATES having to share the information.

If people are paying for a service you‚Äôre offering, access to your content, once we‚Äôre in you need to let us read the content. It‚Äôs fine, you already have the money, and if you want more you need to let the content work its magic. It‚Äôs digital content, so reading it won‚Äôt leave grubby finger marks on the digital pages.

Marvel: please make it easier to find the issues so I can read them. Whatever is going on in your current design is just making me resentful and want to quit. ‚ÄúRage quit‚Äù is not going to lead to me buying anything later. I want to be so invested in the content I end up buying replica magneto helmets and nightcrawler socks and other stuff, but I can‚Äôt get there if the bad website design stays this bad and I give up in frustration instead of engaging in commerce with your business.",Marvel,9,0.67

Question on multiple ongoing books,"So I was born 89' and started reading comics around 8 and got into late 80s early 90s. And my teen years I found these 99' comics never really read them in order or anything it's just the spiderman I REMEMBER like vividly going to the store and seeing.

So I finally read them both again in order. And it's not exactly read the amazing spiderman them Peter parker:spiderman...but it kinda was I'd do 2 issues of asm then over to Peter parker...it was really cool to see oh this is THE SAME MONTH. Or it felt like Peter Parker story took place after the amazing. It was more filler issues, about his life as Peter more than spiderman....

Is there anything similar with other characters where 2 books ran at the same time for like 40-60 issues. And one dealt with like the main story and one dealt with the B story ? ..I feel empty now it's done.",Marvel,0,0.33

How conceptual does the One Above All go?,"
For example, is he someone a human character can actually talk to? Not talk to an avatar but the entire being of the One Above All. Does he have emotions and a personality? 

Or is it more conceptual? 

Conceptual as in like all characters are the One Above All because the One Above All is everything and everywhere. So that means the timelines, the clothes that people wear, the concept of brushing teeth, the being of Eternity, and everything and every thought in the multiverse and beyond are all apart of the One Above All‚Äôs ‚Äúbody‚Äù. In this scenario Doctor Strange cannot defeat the One Above All because if Strange shot a fireball at him, technically that fireball is the One Above All and so is Doctor Strange and the air he breathes, so it would basically do nothing. In this case, he is angry, happy, sad, vengeful, enlightened, depressed, hungry, and full all at the same time and yet he isn‚Äôt feeling anything as well, he is literally (by the definition of literally) nothing and everything at once.

Hyperion's bond with Thor would be great to return.,"Always liked how Hyperion became the brother Thor never had.

During their time together, the two quickly became close friends, with  Hyperion providing a shoulder for Thor to rely on after the events of *Original Sin* stripped him of his ability to lift Mjolnir. Hyperion remained a  companion even when the world faced the end of all things in ""Time Runs  Out.""  

It's pretty obvious how Hyperion also started to grow as he got accustomed to this new world and to the God way more than refering each other as Brothers.

[Hyperion constantly accept\/asking for a share of what Thor drinks is a great touch to symbolise their friendship.](https://preview.redd.it/sgvskzlw1fwc1.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d88f426992014e7120af75afc25fd54c37eca830)

The Children of the Sun begged their adopted father to stay. Hyperion refused to let his best friend go into the unknown without proper backup. Hyperion even came to call Thor his brother, signifying just how  important they came to be to one another. In their final battle, the  pair fought side by side wounded and with an entire army of Beyonders moving to attack them, the pair met their ends as brothers in arms, even vowing to find one another in Valhalla.

It's a great touch of the Hickman run on Avengers and the Incursions  saga as a whole, giving Thor and Hyperion someone they can fully relate to and actually relax around.¬†He enjoyed a¬†stint on a briefly-lived version of Squadron Supreme, found a civilian life as a truck driver to see America, and took part in the events of Secret Empire (where he was one of the many heroes tested by the corrupted Captain America's plans).

Getting into comics,"I have been reading comics for over a year but have mostly stuck to the smaller publishers or DC Vertigo as I find the continuity aspect of Marvel and DC very confusing. However I have recently read Spider-Man life story and I'm about half way through Ultimate Spider-Man which I am enjoying.

I have just realised that Ultimate Spider-Man is not set in the same universe as other comics (other than the ultimate series). Does this matter? Have I picked a bad starting point to get into it?

I have also started watching the original X Men Animated Series and not sure where to start with the comics if i don't have any background on X Men other than the cartoon. Should i go with Ultimate X Men or something else?

Finally, I like the idea of getting into a few Marvel ongoing titles so i have a few floppys to look forward to each month but I think I need more knowledge on the correct universe and what is happening in the comics at the moment to get into it. Are there any runs that have recently started or will start soon that I could easily jump on and enjoy? ",Marvel,1,0.67

Political positions of superheroes ,"Thor is disinterested and doesn‚Äôt care about politics. 

Ironman is obviously a George W. Bush republican. 

Captain America is odd. He would‚Äôve supported the old-school government, and would‚Äôve obviously been an FDR New Deal democrat. But a lot of his comics are centered around the fact that the government can‚Äôt be trusted, with massive organizations like SHIELD. He‚Äôs probably one of those people that believes that politics is too fucked up in the modern day, and misses the era of Roosevelt.

^ He is obviously somebody who would be a social democrat though. 

As far as I can tell, Hawkeye is just a chill guy who doesn‚Äôt care. Matt Fraction‚Äôs run epitomized him well. He‚Äôs the kind of guy that just wants to go home and fall asleep watching TV after a long day, not argue about politics.

Spider-Man is easy, he‚Äôd be a Democrat. He‚Äôs a kid from NYC, who idolizes people like Captain America.

Reed Richards reminds me of Woodrow Wilson. Somebody who believes that the president should be as powerful as possible.

Punisher wouldn‚Äôt really care, but he‚Äôd hunt down any corrupt politicians.

He and his buddy stand over the unconscious man and reveal had the protagonist not punched him and kept running there was nothing he could do.

Besides Peter and Miles I mean, this comic is set between the first game and Miles‚Äô solo game, so no Wraith or FF yet, and it‚Äôs been made quite clear that Peter doesn‚Äôt know Dr.Strange either. And both state that despite The Avengers being stationed in New York, they are almost never around to use the tower since they are so busy.

I‚Äôm curious to see hear what other people think of this.

Personally I think the other half dozen heroes regularly in Manhattan, he spoke of are Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Moon Knight, and finally Cloak and Dagger.

 I would love, LOVE to say Luke Cage, but there is no way that man tolerates the Underground-Roxxon War going down in Harlem. He would have kicked some ass. Also it‚Äôs my headcanon that the X-Men are currently stationed in San Francisco rather than New York.

Movies I did not like: The most recent Thor (badass villain got no screen time and the humor tried too hard). Eternals fell a little flat. Black Widow deserved better. 

The Disney+ shows I liked: WandaVision and Loki (S1) were amazing. Top notch tv and great additions imo. Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier felt rushed and spotty at times, but considering the filming restrictions, I liked it. Moonknight was very cool and so was What If? Oh and the Hawkeye special. 

I did not really care for Ms. Marvel because the story was poorly written and the style was too different for my taste. Not bad, but not great. She-Hulk wasn‚Äôt that bad it was whatever.

Deadpool 3 is a love letter to Gen X and Late Millennials... and DOOM!,"I did post this in a comic threat. So sorry if this is a double post. 

After watching all the Deadpool and Wolverine movies trailers I have come to one conclusion. This is the last run of Fox Marvel, and a love letter to us old marvel movie fans. Obviously the younger millennials and gen z grew up with the movies but us old men/women lived through it. I still remember my friends and me at the midnight showing of the original X Men movie. I have all sorts of memories like that. And I can only assume Ryan Reynolds was the same way.

From just being in it for a second or actually having real screen time... they are getting the band back together again! From Ang Lee Hulk (I think) and Elektra and New Mutants to more money makers like the X Men, they are all showing up. There is just one movie that hasn't shown up in the trailer... and it could be the entrance of DOCTOR DOOM.

Nowhere in the previews have I seen any reference of the two Fantastic Four movies. Now this could be because of the Fantastic Four marvel movie coming up, but it doesn't stop them from using others. If there is one villain who would use hero's jumping into alternate time lines to the main marvel universe, it would be Doom. And this wouldn't be the first time Doctor Doom would have pulled this off. From Secret Wars to Onslaught, the mad lad had done it before.

So yes, this is my latest how Dr Doom will show up in the MCU. Either way, Deadpool 3 is going to be pure awesomeness.",Marvel,0,0.36

Which Marvel villains don't make sense as characters?,"Which Marvel villains don't make sense as characters? I am not talking about the science behind guys like Sandman, Electro, or Klaw not making sense, Marvel comic books are not science textbooks, those are acceptable creative liberties.

I am talking about villains who don't make sense as characters. I am not talking about a character with a simple motivation, if your actions fit your motive, it's fine. Bullseye likes to kill people and get paid for it, he could make money legitimately elsewhere, but his love of violence prevents him from doing so, and that's fine.

So I am going to pick on two Fantastic Four villains, Trapster and Wizard. Trapster's motive is supposed to be greed, but why didn't he just patent his glue and market it, he could have made millions legitimately, but didn't, for no good reason. Trapster has nearly died several times, gets punched out by superheroes constantly, and has been subjected to Ghost Rider's penance stare and he is still a supervillain, why? The writers also can't decide whether he is a real serious supervillain or a comic relief character, pick one lane and go with it. Either have Trapster quit, up his game by a lot, and pick on a street-level character instead of a team that fights gods for a living or have him be a purely comic relief character. There is a prose novel short story from the 90s where Trapster tries to reform, that is more interesting character work than anything that has been done with him in the comics, but it's not canon.

&amp;#x200B;

Wizard is worse on this score, he has even less reason to be a public supervillain, if he wasn't a public supervillain with a record he would be a dangerous force in the business world. Instead, he is a third-rate supervillain. He is jealous of the FF's fame and Reed Richard's abilities, but did he think becoming a public supervillain would make him more beloved than the FF? He is supposed to be smart, but he makes the same stupid mistakes over and over again, he always tries to defeat the FF with a Frightful Four instead of trying to overwhelm them with a Frightful Fourteen, he and the Frightful do not seem remotely in the Fantastic Four's league. He's too evil to be sympathetic and not evil enough to actually be sinister or menacing. He is similar to the type of villains kid shows have been parodying for the last 20 years.

Guys need opinions on a decision related to comics ,"So as I have mentioned before I'm a old comics fan I have read both marvel and DC even some image and valiant. I used to read comics a lot during my teenage years, years ago but I stopped and been reading only manga for a while but lately I have been getting the feeling to return to comics which I kinda did since last week I have been reading Superman and action comics 90s since I didn't get to read them years ago I've only read Superman 2000s, new 52 and rebirth . 

And I still enjoy comics so I'm confused whether to fully return to comics or stay sticking only to manga like I have been since years now since doing both will overwhelming I still got a lot manga on my reading list I plan to read if I add also comics I'll be overwhelmed especially for DC . As for marvel I have already read nearly every marvel character their 90s, 2000s, 2010s comics I only got newerer current marvel comics to read . DC I have read a lot of it too in the past but not everything there's still some older DC titles I didn't read besides the newer current titles .

My thoughts on Phoenix Saga,"**Let me preface this by saying that this is the first time I have ever read an X-men comic of any kind. My experience with the X-men is solely due to the various animated shows and movies. After years of watching the MCU I decided to read Marvel comics. I decided to start with X-men because I felt like the animated offerings were good to great but the movies, most of the time, were bad. I wanted to see what they were actually like.**

**Now this doesn‚Äôt mean I am oblivious to X-men. I am proud to be a pretty nerdy guy so over the last 33 years of my life I have stumbled on comic art, comic book covers, and what I would consider light spoilers over that time.**

**After doing some research I decided to start from the very beginning for two reasons. 1) I thought it would be interesting to see how these characters change and evolve over time. 2) The original X-men comic was canceled which meant I didn‚Äôt have to read 200+ issues to hit Uncanny X-men. I only had to make my way through 66.**

**Previously I did review, or at least, my thoughts on the original X-men run.**

[https://new.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1buud2a/my\_thoughts\_on\_silver\_age\_xmen\_maybe\_light/](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1buud2a/my_thoughts_on_silver_age_xmen_maybe_light/)

**If you are not interested in reading that, to sum it up, I overall liked it. Way more than most people like The Silver Age X-men. I originally was going to do my thoughts on Uncanny X-men Omnibus vol 1 but I decided to forego that and instead do my thoughts on The Phoenix Saga which I am counting as staring on issue #101 and going up to #138**

**So without further ado let's get to it.**

Issue 101: I have seen the cover of this issue before. The phoenix bursting out of the water. I know the loose cliff notes version of the Phoenix saga in comics. This was my first time actually reading the story though and I will have to say the first couple pages are what I expected. Jean Grey crashed into the ocean before bursting forth from it. What I didn‚Äôt expect was afterwards her ending up in a hospital bed as Cyclops stays by her side, the others go on a vacation.

Honestly that was my biggest surprise about the Phoenix Saga how long it lasted. I could only imagine what it must have been like picking it up as they came out. Overall a great start to the Phoenix Saga.

Issue #105-#108: I have no idea if this is a hot take but after reading this arc and thinking back to the silver age I have realized something. I do not like when the X-men deal with aliens or go into space. I don‚Äôt even know what to say about this arc really. The alien civil war did nothing for me and finding out Cyclop‚Äôs dad was Corsair was a neat idea but I am about twelve issues into the Uncanny Omnibus Vol 2 now and nothing has come of this yet. The ending was cool was the phoenix but other from that‚Ä¶ eh.

**So the rest I will kind of shoot off the top of my head as the rest of what happens with Phoenix is kind of scattered and peppered throughout.**

Jason Wyngarde was a very intriguing and interesting villain as is the idea of the black queen. The only question I have is‚Ä¶ did he really not know she was phoenix? Why did he just want Jean Grey? When the Phoenix kills him I believe it is Cyclops that says that Jason had no idea Phoenix was a thing but I swear Jason was also the one that said that he had accounted for her getting mad and upset after he attacked Cyclops. It was cool to see Mastermind again though.

Cyclops went from my least favorite X-men to one of my favorites. Same with Wolverine. In the beginning of Chris Clarmont‚Äôs run I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder why Wolverine was so darn popular. By the time the volume 1 omnibus concluded I understood it. I would also like to do a re-read one day where I track when Wolverine went from being an unruly asshole to giving off more loveable drunken uncle vibes.

Storm is easily my new favorite x-men. Enough said.

Ok. Enough mucking around let's talk about the actual event. I understand why the phoenix saga is so beloved now. A true epic. Do I believe that there are better stories that have taken place in the comic medium since? Yes. For the time though I understand why this was such a big deal and why people hold it in such high regard. The last five issues or so when the X-men walked into the hellfire club to Cyclops recounting his time as an X-men and walking off is easily one the best stories I have had the pleasure to read. That is to say nothing of everything else.

I think the only thing I was slightly confused on is what Phoenix was exactly? Me reading issue after issue may have fuzzed some details. However, I can‚Äôt help but ask‚Ä¶ It came from the solar flare, correct? It was obviously some cosmic entity and not like the movies portray where it is a part of her? If anyone can give me some insight into this that would be nice.

All in all I would give it 8.5.",Marvel,0,0.17

Small review for Ultimates 1&amp;2,"I always watched the ultimate avengers movies religiously as a kid, which made me want to read this series in the first place. It wasn‚Äôt the train wreck that I initially thought to be. I wouldn‚Äôt call them good, but entertaining. Some of the costume designs were questionable to say the least. I absolutely loathe the iron man suits. I thought all his suits were abysmal. I like how they made Bucky into an old man and not the winter soldier in this universe. The relationships in this series are hit or miss. I wasn‚Äôt invested in any of it. Jan, Hank, and Black Widow are fucking dicks, so I have no interest of what‚Äôs happening to them. Black Widow being the mole for the team was predictable for me idk about everyone but as soon as it was told that there was a mole in the team. I enjoyed it overall, I wouldn‚Äôt mind rereading it, but I have some questions down below? 

Was this the comic book series that made Nick Fury black?

Steve Englehart helped introduce Beast to the Avengers in the 70s, and several of his successors kept Hank on the team until the early 80s.

You guys feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but, with everything that's happened so far and what's yet to be resolved, we have the following: 

Tombstone's Plan for Spidey

Peter's relationship status (particularly with M)

Norman Osborn's Sins

New Sinister Six Plot 

Chasm/Hallow's Eve Plot 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's all the major story beats that Wells needs to resolve before ending his run. Considering that Tombstone was teased in Web of Spider-Man, and the Chasm stuff seems like it's getting resolved in the next issue maybe, all that's left is this Sinister Six polot and how Norman's sins are going to play into it. My guess for what's going to happen is as follows: 

Norman's sins fully manifest in Norman, prompting the return of the Green Goblin. Exploiting the now hot potato nature of his sins, Green Goblin uses them to re-corrupt Peter. Giving birth to this Spider-Goblin. When Peter was possessed last time, he went on a hitlist of all that wronged him in his life. So, given this time he seems fully transformed by the sins, Spider-Goblin goes on a rampage. Targeting the Sinister Six and everything that's wronged him in his life, including the Green Goblin (which, based on ASM 54's cover, seems like the two goblins are gonna duke it out and the end). Mj, Paul, Randy and the other supporting characters will probably play a big role across these 5 issues. All the while, Tombstone will continue amassing resources for his plan to take out Spider-Man once and for. With issues 55 through 60 being Tombstone's plot and the final arc of the Wells run. Ending with hopefully a final resolution on Peter and MJS relationship and a final showdown between Spider-Man and Tombstone. 

What do you guys think? Am I missing anything? In a weird way, I'm kind of excited to see where this Spider-Goblin storyline goes considering how long it is (an 80 page issue with four following issues). Though it's still so weird that Peter was the goblin being teased all along. Maybe after this, he can better empathize with Chasm since it seems like a similar mirror/storybeat. ",Marvel,0,0.5

70s and 80s style not suiting,"Hi... Over the last two years, I have bought a number of marvel epic collections. The whole idea behind this purchase was to enjoy reading the stories from the very beginning and in a warped way, I thought I would like those old stories more than the modern style of storytelling. 

Turns out after reading a couple of epics as well as modern takes on characters like Immortal Hulk and Garth Ennis' The Punisher, I like the modern style more than the older campy ones. Now I am stuck with a bunch of epics covering the initial runs of characters and I generally feel like selling them off. What do you suggest? Any advice will be appreciated as I feel I have splurged quite a lot on the epics and feel guilty as they lie gathering dust on my shelves.... Sorry if this feels like a rant ",Marvel,1,0.6

Spider-Man live action series (1977),"Starring Nicholas Hammond as Peter Parker the 1977-79 Spider-Man series aired sporadically for two seasons and 12 episodes  after airing a successful 90 minute pilot.

Due to concern over the series not attracting an older demographic, CBS ordered five first season and seven second season episodes which aired in no set time slot.

The series was ultimately cancelled due to CBS not wanting to be known as the comic book show network due to them already airing Wonder Woman, The Incredible Hulk and airing pilots of Dr. Strange and Captain America.

He heard the man begging, he heard the man threatening, all he needed to do was saying the exact words he said after the guy ""died"" and ruined his own life.

I know he's not a social genious but, come on, he should be written better than ""Oh I was too distracted to tell the only important piece of information in the whole conversation that clearly had a man begging me to help him"". It wasn't even like he was doing something important, he was casually fiddling with whaveter the hell that sphere was, and all he really need to say was ""I bought your company to save it"" followed by ""You'll still be in charge of it"".",Marvel,1,1.0
Update on Daredevil by me.,"So the other day I posted some design ideas I had for a Daredevil suit. And now I've drawn a rough sketch of my design. I wanted to make the suit a rusty red sort of color and I think it turned out good, as well as the mask and horns which were the main parts I wanted to change from other suits. In the final version I'll probably bring the mask down lower.

In the final version I'm going to try and make the color blending better, work on my anatomy, and fix a few small issues such as the rosary being messed up the billy clubs being too small, and the beard and hair (I drew this in pen first not intending to add color so thats why the beard is black with some orange colored over it.)

So please tell me what you think. And any more experienced artists who have any tips especially for anatomy (specifically legs) please leave them below.

Malekith is a recurring villain in the comics and a HUGE threat to Thor. The movie did him dirty. 

Ultron is another recurring villain that somehow died in just one movie. Absolutely heinous to his character. 

Mordo became a loose end that they decided to ignore and do absolutely nothing with. 

Gorr was a MENACE in his small section of the Thor God of Thunder run. He almost killed 3 different iterations of Thor that teamed up to kill him. He killed so many Gods and even brought down Omnipotence City. 

Vision just got his ass beat in every scene hes in after Age of Ultron and brought absolutely nothing to the table despite being one of the most powerful characters in the Avengers.

How conceptual does the One Above All go?,"
For example, is he someone a human character can actually talk to? Not talk to an avatar but the entire being of the One Above All. Does he have emotions and a personality? 

Or is it more conceptual? 

Conceptual as in like all characters are the One Above All because the One Above All is everything and everywhere. So that means the timelines, the clothes that people wear, the concept of brushing teeth, the being of Eternity, and everything and every thought in the multiverse and beyond are all apart of the One Above All‚Äôs ‚Äúbody‚Äù. In this scenario Doctor Strange cannot defeat the One Above All because if Strange shot a fireball at him, technically that fireball is the One Above All and so is Doctor Strange and the air he breathes, so it would basically do nothing. In this case, he is angry, happy, sad, vengeful, enlightened, depressed, hungry, and full all at the same time and yet he isn‚Äôt feeling anything as well, he is literally (by the definition of literally) nothing and everything at once.

Hyperion's bond with Thor would be great to return.,"Always liked how Hyperion became the brother Thor never had.

During their time together, the two quickly became close friends, with  Hyperion providing a shoulder for Thor to rely on after the events of *Original Sin* stripped him of his ability to lift Mjolnir. Hyperion remained a  companion even when the world faced the end of all things in ""Time Runs  Out.""  

It's pretty obvious how Hyperion also started to grow as he got accustomed to this new world and to the God way more than refering each other as Brothers.

[Hyperion constantly accept\/asking for a share of what Thor drinks is a great touch to symbolise their friendship.](https://preview.redd.it/sgvskzlw1fwc1.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d88f426992014e7120af75afc25fd54c37eca830)

The Children of the Sun begged their adopted father to stay. Hyperion refused to let his best friend go into the unknown without proper backup. Hyperion even came to call Thor his brother, signifying just how  important they came to be to one another. In their final battle, the  pair fought side by side wounded and with an entire army of Beyonders moving to attack them, the pair met their ends as brothers in arms, even vowing to find one another in Valhalla.

It's a great touch of the Hickman run on Avengers and the Incursions  saga as a whole, giving Thor and Hyperion someone they can fully relate to and actually relax around.¬†He enjoyed a¬†stint on a briefly-lived version of Squadron Supreme, found a civilian life as a truck driver to see America, and took part in the events of Secret Empire (where he was one of the many heroes tested by the corrupted Captain America's plans).

Getting into comics,"I have been reading comics for over a year but have mostly stuck to the smaller publishers or DC Vertigo as I find the continuity aspect of Marvel and DC very confusing. However I have recently read Spider-Man life story and I'm about half way through Ultimate Spider-Man which I am enjoying.

I have just realised that Ultimate Spider-Man is not set in the same universe as other comics (other than the ultimate series). Does this matter? Have I picked a bad starting point to get into it?

I have also started watching the original X Men Animated Series and not sure where to start with the comics if i don't have any background on X Men other than the cartoon. Should i go with Ultimate X Men or something else?

Finally, I like the idea of getting into a few Marvel ongoing titles so i have a few floppys to look forward to each month but I think I need more knowledge on the correct universe and what is happening in the comics at the moment to get into it. Are there any runs that have recently started or will start soon that I could easily jump on and enjoy? ",Marvel,1,0.67

I'm on a big single issue 90's comics kick after reading **The Punisher Meets Archie, Batman - Two Face -Crime and Punishment, and Punisher/Batman.** 

It doesn't need to be superheroes, It just needs to be well paced.

Political positions of superheroes ,"Thor is disinterested and doesn‚Äôt care about politics. 

Ironman is obviously a George W. Bush republican. 

Captain America is odd. He would‚Äôve supported the old-school government, and would‚Äôve obviously been an FDR New Deal democrat. But a lot of his comics are centered around the fact that the government can‚Äôt be trusted, with massive organizations like SHIELD. He‚Äôs probably one of those people that believes that politics is too fucked up in the modern day, and misses the era of Roosevelt.

^ He is obviously somebody who would be a social democrat though. 

As far as I can tell, Hawkeye is just a chill guy who doesn‚Äôt care. Matt Fraction‚Äôs run epitomized him well. He‚Äôs the kind of guy that just wants to go home and fall asleep watching TV after a long day, not argue about politics.

Spider-Man is easy, he‚Äôd be a Democrat. He‚Äôs a kid from NYC, who idolizes people like Captain America.

Reed Richards reminds me of Woodrow Wilson. Somebody who believes that the president should be as powerful as possible.

Punisher wouldn‚Äôt really care, but he‚Äôd hunt down any corrupt politicians. 

I can‚Äôt see any of the X-Men as Republicans‚Ä¶lol

Either Nomad, Darkhawk unarmored, or sleepwalkers day human form was investigating a building they got cornered and tried to run and saw a smirking villain so he punched the guy which the guy didn't seem to feel. The when the protagonist is like "" I didn't think I was that weak"" the villain compliments his strength and says it's about "" this strong"" and pimp slaps him knocking him out. He and his buddy stand over the unconscious man and reveal had the protagonist not punched him and kept running there was nothing he could do. And that the protagonist would have known that if he knew his name. Then had a name like equilibrium or impulse or inertia or some science stuff. None of those panned out when I googled.",Marvel,1,0.67

"Who do you think are the Half Dozen heroes regularly in Manhattan, in Insomniac?","
Besides Peter and Miles I mean, this comic is set between the first game and Miles‚Äô solo game, so no Wraith or FF yet, and it‚Äôs been made quite clear that Peter doesn‚Äôt know Dr.Strange either. And both state that despite The Avengers being stationed in New York, they are almost never around to use the tower since they are so busy.

I‚Äôm curious to see hear what other people think of this.

Personally I think the other half dozen heroes regularly in Manhattan, he spoke of are Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Moon Knight, and finally Cloak and Dagger.

 I would love, LOVE to say Luke Cage, but there is no way that man tolerates the Underground-Roxxon War going down in Harlem. He would have kicked some ass. Also it‚Äôs my headcanon that the X-Men are currently stationed in San Francisco rather than New York.

So I‚Äôd love to hear who you think are the Half Dozen.

Movies I did not like: The most recent Thor (badass villain got no screen time and the humor tried too hard). Eternals fell a little flat. Black Widow deserved better. 

The Disney+ shows I liked: WandaVision and Loki (S1) were amazing. Top notch tv and great additions imo. Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier felt rushed and spotty at times, but considering the filming restrictions, I liked it. Moonknight was very cool and so was What If? Oh and the Hawkeye special. 

I did not really care for Ms. Marvel because the story was poorly written and the style was too different for my taste. Not bad, but not great. She-Hulk wasn‚Äôt that bad it was whatever. 

I know since then there have been many more to come out but I don‚Äôt know where to start or in what order. Based on what I‚Äôve liked and disliked, what can I watch that‚Äôs not a waste of time or just cheesy and boring ‚Äúfiller.‚Äù

Deadpool 3 is a love letter to Gen X and Late Millennials... and DOOM!,"I did post this in a comic threat. So sorry if this is a double post. 

After watching all the Deadpool and Wolverine movies trailers I have come to one conclusion. This is the last run of Fox Marvel, and a love letter to us old marvel movie fans. Obviously the younger millennials and gen z grew up with the movies but us old men/women lived through it. I still remember my friends and me at the midnight showing of the original X Men movie. I have all sorts of memories like that. And I can only assume Ryan Reynolds was the same way.

From just being in it for a second or actually having real screen time... they are getting the band back together again! From Ang Lee Hulk (I think) and Elektra and New Mutants to more money makers like the X Men, they are all showing up. There is just one movie that hasn't shown up in the trailer... and it could be the entrance of DOCTOR DOOM.

Nowhere in the previews have I seen any reference of the two Fantastic Four movies. Now this could be because of the Fantastic Four marvel movie coming up, but it doesn't stop them from using others. If there is one villain who would use hero's jumping into alternate time lines to the main marvel universe, it would be Doom. And this wouldn't be the first time Doctor Doom would have pulled this off. From Secret Wars to Onslaught, the mad lad had done it before.

So yes, this is my latest how Dr Doom will show up in the MCU. Either way, Deadpool 3 is going to be pure awesomeness.",Marvel,0,0.4

Which Marvel villains don't make sense as characters?,"Which Marvel villains don't make sense as characters? I am not talking about the science behind guys like Sandman, Electro, or Klaw not making sense, Marvel comic books are not science textbooks, those are acceptable creative liberties.

I am talking about villains who don't make sense as characters. I am not talking about a character with a simple motivation, if your actions fit your motive, it's fine. Bullseye likes to kill people and get paid for it, he could make money legitimately elsewhere, but his love of violence prevents him from doing so, and that's fine.

So I am going to pick on two Fantastic Four villains, Trapster and Wizard. Trapster's motive is supposed to be greed, but why didn't he just patent his glue and market it, he could have made millions legitimately, but didn't, for no good reason. Trapster has nearly died several times, gets punched out by superheroes constantly, and has been subjected to Ghost Rider's penance stare and he is still a supervillain, why? The writers also can't decide whether he is a real serious supervillain or a comic relief character, pick one lane and go with it. Either have Trapster quit, up his game by a lot, and pick on a street-level character instead of a team that fights gods for a living or have him be a purely comic relief character. There is a prose novel short story from the 90s where Trapster tries to reform, that is more interesting character work than anything that has been done with him in the comics, but it's not canon.

&amp;#x200B;

Wizard is worse on this score, he has even less reason to be a public supervillain, if he wasn't a public supervillain with a record he would be a dangerous force in the business world. Instead, he is a third-rate supervillain. He is jealous of the FF's fame and Reed Richard's abilities, but did he think becoming a public supervillain would make him more beloved than the FF? He is supposed to be smart, but he makes the same stupid mistakes over and over again, he always tries to defeat the FF with a Frightful Four instead of trying to overwhelm them with a Frightful Fourteen, he and the Frightful do not seem remotely in the Fantastic Four's league. He's too evil to be sympathetic and not evil enough to actually be sinister or menacing. He is similar to the type of villains kid shows have been parodying for the last 20 years.

Guys need opinions on a decision related to comics ,"So as I have mentioned before I'm a old comics fan I have read both marvel and DC even some image and valiant. I used to read comics a lot during my teenage years, years ago but I stopped and been reading only manga for a while but lately I have been getting the feeling to return to comics which I kinda did since last week I have been reading Superman and action comics 90s since I didn't get to read them years ago I've only read Superman 2000s, new 52 and rebirth . 

And I still enjoy comics so I'm confused whether to fully return to comics or stay sticking only to manga like I have been since years now since doing both will overwhelming I still got a lot manga on my reading list I plan to read if I add also comics I'll be overwhelmed especially for DC . As for marvel I have already read nearly every marvel character their 90s, 2000s, 2010s comics I only got newerer current marvel comics to read . DC I have read a lot of it too in the past but not everything there's still some older DC titles I didn't read besides the newer current titles .

And yes I have read more Marvel than DC during my teenage years. So if anyone wants to give their opinion what to choose whether manga or comics ? ",Marvel,0,0.4

My thoughts on Phoenix Saga,"**Let me preface this by saying that this is the first time I have ever read an X-men comic of any kind. My experience with the X-men is solely due to the various animated shows and movies. After years of watching the MCU I decided to read Marvel comics. I decided to start with X-men because I felt like the animated offerings were good to great but the movies, most of the time, were bad. I wanted to see what they were actually like.**

**Now this doesn‚Äôt mean I am oblivious to X-men. I am proud to be a pretty nerdy guy so over the last 33 years of my life I have stumbled on comic art, comic book covers, and what I would consider light spoilers over that time.**

**After doing some research I decided to start from the very beginning for two reasons. 1) I thought it would be interesting to see how these characters change and evolve over time. 2) The original X-men comic was canceled which meant I didn‚Äôt have to read 200+ issues to hit Uncanny X-men. I only had to make my way through 66.**

**Previously I did review, or at least, my thoughts on the original X-men run.**

[https://new.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1buud2a/my\_thoughts\_on\_silver\_age\_xmen\_maybe\_light/](https://new.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1buud2a/my_thoughts_on_silver_age_xmen_maybe_light/)

**If you are not interested in reading that, to sum it up, I overall liked it. Way more than most people like The Silver Age X-men. I originally was going to do my thoughts on Uncanny X-men Omnibus vol 1 but I decided to forego that and instead do my thoughts on The Phoenix Saga which I am counting as staring on issue #101 and going up to #138**

**So without further ado let's get to it.**

Issue 101: I have seen the cover of this issue before. The phoenix bursting out of the water. I know the loose cliff notes version of the Phoenix saga in comics. This was my first time actually reading the story though and I will have to say the first couple pages are what I expected. Jean Grey crashed into the ocean before bursting forth from it. What I didn‚Äôt expect was afterwards her ending up in a hospital bed as Cyclops stays by her side, the others go on a vacation.

Honestly that was my biggest surprise about the Phoenix Saga how long it lasted. I could only imagine what it must have been like picking it up as they came out. Overall a great start to the Phoenix Saga.

Issue #105-#108: I have no idea if this is a hot take but after reading this arc and thinking back to the silver age I have realized something. I do not like when the X-men deal with aliens or go into space. I don‚Äôt even know what to say about this arc really. The alien civil war did nothing for me and finding out Cyclop‚Äôs dad was Corsair was a neat idea but I am about twelve issues into the Uncanny Omnibus Vol 2 now and nothing has come of this yet. The ending was cool was the phoenix but other from that‚Ä¶ eh.

**So the rest I will kind of shoot off the top of my head as the rest of what happens with Phoenix is kind of scattered and peppered throughout.**

Jason Wyngarde was a very intriguing and interesting villain as is the idea of the black queen. The only question I have is‚Ä¶ did he really not know she was phoenix? Why did he just want Jean Grey? When the Phoenix kills him I believe it is Cyclops that says that Jason had no idea Phoenix was a thing but I swear Jason was also the one that said that he had accounted for her getting mad and upset after he attacked Cyclops. It was cool to see Mastermind again though.

Cyclops went from my least favorite X-men to one of my favorites. Same with Wolverine. In the beginning of Chris Clarmont‚Äôs run I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder why Wolverine was so darn popular. By the time the volume 1 omnibus concluded I understood it. I would also like to do a re-read one day where I track when Wolverine went from being an unruly asshole to giving off more loveable drunken uncle vibes.

Storm is easily my new favorite x-men. Enough said.

Ok. Enough mucking around let's talk about the actual event. I understand why the phoenix saga is so beloved now. A true epic. Do I believe that there are better stories that have taken place in the comic medium since? Yes. For the time though I understand why this was such a big deal and why people hold it in such high regard. The last five issues or so when the X-men walked into the hellfire club to Cyclops recounting his time as an X-men and walking off is easily one the best stories I have had the pleasure to read. That is to say nothing of everything else.

I think the only thing I was slightly confused on is what Phoenix was exactly? Me reading issue after issue may have fuzzed some details. However, I can‚Äôt help but ask‚Ä¶ It came from the solar flare, correct? It was obviously some cosmic entity and not like the movies portray where it is a part of her? If anyone can give me some insight into this that would be nice.

All in all I would give it 8.5.",Marvel,0,0.25

The relationships in this series are hit or miss. I wasn‚Äôt invested in any of it. Jan, Hank, and Black Widow are fucking dicks, so I have no interest of what‚Äôs happening to them. Black Widow being the mole for the team was predictable for me idk about everyone but as soon as it was told that there was a mole in the team. I enjoyed it overall, I wouldn‚Äôt mind rereading it, but I have some questions down below? 

Was this the comic book series that made Nick Fury black?

You finally open up your eyes and instead of seeing anything you may recognize you immediately take notice of a large bright light above your face and multiple different monitors around you.*

The introduction to **X-Men: Xcel**, where you begin as a young Mutant, not knowing where you are or even who you are. In the game you will learn exactly who your character was before, but more importantly, who your character will be next.

Play as someone lost in their head, someone free in the world or someone clinging to an unknown past, or even someone completely new. It's all up to you as to how the world will develop and who knows? How you act may influence those around you, so be careful.

The first release of **X-Men: Xcel** will include the introduction sequence and a handful of characters to meet, the game will continuously be updated every couple weeks or once a month depending on my own schedule.

Get ready for the first release, currently planned for **late April!**

If you, or anyone you know, are skilled with Twine and/or HTML coding then please message me if you would like to contribute to the game! I am in dire need of coding assistance and/or writers!

Geoff Johns wrote his run as the aftermath of Kurt Busiek's Kang Dynasty in the Avengers. Steve Englehart helped introduce Beast to the Avengers in the 70s, and several of his successors kept Hank on the team until the early 80s.

*"" ABOUT AMAZING SPIDER-MAN BY ZEB WELLS VOL. 11: GOING GREEN* 

***Zeb Wells‚Äô highly talked-about Spider-Man run reaches a climax with the return of the Green Goblin!***  
*The greatest villain in Spider-Man history is back, and about to remind Spider-Man ‚Äî along with all of us ‚Äî exactly why he‚Äôs so feared! And as if the Goblin isn‚Äôt enough, the Sinister Six are here too ‚Äî along with several other problems that will soon destroy Spider-Man‚Äôs life once and for all!""*

[*https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/746639/amazing-spider-man-by-zeb-wells-vol-11-going-green-by-zeb-wells/*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/746639/amazing-spider-man-by-zeb-wells-vol-11-going-green-by-zeb-wells/) 

You guys feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but, with everything that's happened so far and what's yet to be resolved, we have the following: 

Tombstone's Plan for Spidey

Peter's relationship status (particularly with M)

Norman Osborn's Sins

New Sinister Six Plot 

Chasm/Hallow's Eve Plot 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's all the major story beats that Wells needs to resolve before ending his run. Considering that Tombstone was teased in Web of Spider-Man, and the Chasm stuff seems like it's getting resolved in the next issue maybe, all that's left is this Sinister Six polot and how Norman's sins are going to play into it. My guess for what's going to happen is as follows: 

Norman's sins fully manifest in Norman, prompting the return of the Green Goblin. Exploiting the now hot potato nature of his sins, Green Goblin uses them to re-corrupt Peter. Giving birth to this Spider-Goblin. When Peter was possessed last time, he went on a hitlist of all that wronged him in his life. So, given this time he seems fully transformed by the sins, Spider-Goblin goes on a rampage. Targeting the Sinister Six and everything that's wronged him in his life, including the Green Goblin (which, based on ASM 54's cover, seems like the two goblins are gonna duke it out and the end). Mj, Paul, Randy and the other supporting characters will probably play a big role across these 5 issues. All the while, Tombstone will continue amassing resources for his plan to take out Spider-Man once and for. With issues 55 through 60 being Tombstone's plot and the final arc of the Wells run. Ending with hopefully a final resolution on Peter and MJS relationship and a final showdown between Spider-Man and Tombstone. 

What do you guys think? Am I missing anything? In a weird way, I'm kind of excited to see where this Spider-Goblin storyline goes considering how long it is (an 80 page issue with four following issues). Though it's still so weird that Peter was the goblin being teased all along. Maybe after this, he can better empathize with Chasm since it seems like a similar mirror/storybeat. ",Marvel,0,0.5

He heard the man begging, he heard the man threatening, all he needed to do was saying the exact words he said after the guy ""died"" and ruined his own life.

I know he's not a social genious but, come on, he should be written better than ""Oh I was too distracted to tell the only important piece of information in the whole conversation that clearly had a man begging me to help him"". It wasn't even like he was doing something important, he was casually fiddling with whaveter the hell that sphere was, and all he really need to say was ""I bought your company to save it"" followed by ""You'll still be in charge of it"".",Marvel,1,1.0
Update on Daredevil by me.,"So the other day I posted some design ideas I had for a Daredevil suit. And now I've drawn a rough sketch of my design. I wanted to make the suit a rusty red sort of color and I think it turned out good, as well as the mask and horns which were the main parts I wanted to change from other suits. In the final version I'll probably bring the mask down lower.

In the final version I'm going to try and make the color blending better, work on my anatomy, and fix a few small issues such as the rosary being messed up the billy clubs being too small, and the beard and hair (I drew this in pen first not intending to add color so thats why the beard is black with some orange colored over it.)

So please tell me what you think. And any more experienced artists who have any tips especially for anatomy (specifically legs) please leave them below.

Why hasn‚Äôt any writer decided to give the Headmen there big come back yet?,The Headmen are the glorious creation of Steve Gerber in the very trippy 70s Defenders despite looking like one shots there the closest the team had to their own Masters of Evil. A rag tag group of mad scientist who did weird stuff to there heads. Tho despite being D list Ruby Thursday became something of the breakout star of the group as she has managed to appear in several other titles as a solo tech villain and possibly had a one night stand with Wolverine.

Keep in mind they're not saying that he's great at playing Johnny Blaze. What they're saying that Nick Cage is great at being entertaining in his usual crazy way.

Can someone explain Captain Britain('s powers)?,"I'm interested in the character of Brian Braddock but the only exposure to him that I recall is in that one storyline in Uncanny X-Force. I read about his powers on the wiki but I'm still confused. It says that he got them from an amulet and a mace or something, then a suit, and now his confidence? 


These are some of my questions. If someone could answer at least one of them then that would be much appreciated, please and thank you 

- What's the appeal of Brian Braddock as a character?

- How did he get his powers and what are they exactly?

- what exactly is Otherworld? What's Brian's role there?

Characters with wasted potential,"My biggest gripe with the MCU is that they have so many characters with wasted potential. In my opinion, this is the order of characters from most wasted potential to least wasted potential. 

Malekith is a recurring villain in the comics and a HUGE threat to Thor. The movie did him dirty. 

Ultron is another recurring villain that somehow died in just one movie. Absolutely heinous to his character. 

Mordo became a loose end that they decided to ignore and do absolutely nothing with. 

Gorr was a MENACE in his small section of the Thor God of Thunder run. He almost killed 3 different iterations of Thor that teamed up to kill him. He killed so many Gods and even brought down Omnipotence City. 

Vision just got his ass beat in every scene hes in after Age of Ultron and brought absolutely nothing to the table despite being one of the most powerful characters in the Avengers. 

Adam Warlock is a character that worries the hell out of me. His introduction plays him like a giant manbaby but of course with that new MCU Comedy twist and its just... worrying.",Marvel,920,0.9

"[Amazing Spider-Man Family #1] ""Shadow of the Green Goblin"" made me check out some older JMD stories.","And man, what a legend good ol' J Marc Dematteis is.

To me, ""The Lost Hunt"" was a light in the darkness during the Wells run, and ""Shadow of the Green Goblin"" was even better. JMD's voice for Peter and everyone else was beyond impeccable. But one aspect that stood out to me, was Peter being confused about his Powers because he doesn't know their extent or how to control them yet, which leads him to wonder whether he was a hero or a monster. It felt like a very real look into a kid who suddenly got those powers.

Anyways, an editor's note sent me to ""Amazing Spider-Man Family"", and I discovered a few stories by JMD that really scratched my itch. This excerpt shows one of Peter's earliest heroics, and does a great job portraying the fear and confusion that a regular teenage boy, one not used to risking his life on a daily basis, would have to push through so early in his career as a Superhero. In all of those stories, JMD really touched on stuff that the Lee/Ditko run didn't, and his stories fit like a glove.
I'm
Personally, I've always loved all those stories set in the Lee/Ditko/Romita era like the brief Amazing Fantasy continuation, Untold Tales of Spider-Man, Spider-Man: Blue, Giant-Size Gwen Stacy and finally JMD's contributions.

"The ""Freaky"" episode with Spider-Man and Wolverine is still funny","I rewatched the Ultimate Spider-Man episode of Spidey and Wolverine switching bodies yesterday. Imo, it's one of the most rewatchable episodes of the show because of how hilariously stupid it is and that they kept the voice actors the same while acting like each other. Although Steve Blum is definitely better at sounding like Spidey in Wolverine's body while Drake Bell isn't good at imitating Wolverine in Spidey's body. If I were to ever make a pitch for a better show than what Ultimate Spider-Man was, I'm definitely keeping this concept since it's too funny to discard.",Marvel,1,0.6

Likable Reed Richards Moments?,"Hi, I constantly see examples of Mr. Fantastic being, at best, a inconsiderate smart moron for the greater good. But I, someone who isn't as familiar with the Fantastic Four, was wondering if anyone had any examples where Reed actually displayed anything about him that makes him charming or likable or whatever. I know about that time he went against AU versions of himself that took over their respective universes, but even at just the most mundane level, is there anything in the comics that made you go, ""yeah, I can see why Ben took a liking to this guy"" or ""okay, Sue, I get what you see in him.""

Change the World Challenge,"After thousands of issues, it‚Äôs easy to see how the Marvel world has been rocked completely by superpowered people and their shenanigans. But just how often does something ‚Äòsuper‚Äô happen? 

Read a random issue and say what events happened that would severely impact our world if they happened in real life. I‚Äôll give some examples:

- Journey into Mystery (1952) #113
The Grey Gargoyle discovers a special formula that allows him to turn anything into stone. If this was real, construction would be so much easier/people would be cautious around statues forever.

- Resurrection of Magneto (2024) #4
A billion dollar platform gets destroyed. This might have been done without the public knowing (I‚Äôm not versed in modern comics yet), but this would have rippling effects on many areas of the economy.

- Children of the Vault (2023) #1
Okay this one‚Äôs just insane. Hundreds/thousands of ‚ÄòTomorrow Towns‚Äô are built around the world. Futuristic technology and medicine are introduced and there‚Äôs natural disasters up the wazoo.

It seems like every single Marvel comic has at least one event that would make breaking news if it happened today. What examples can you find?

Why did the Skrull Queen choose Spider-Woman?,"I just re-read the whole Secret Invasion event, and I don‚Äôt get why the Skrull Queen chose Spider-Woman as the most optimal person to take down the superheroes. Like Verkrane even said herself in some comic that she was the best choice.

Like there are a lot of other super types with way more influence then her, Carol Danvers, Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Steve Rogers, and Wanda Maximoff (before her breakdown) to name a few. Spider-Woman has never really had that wide range honestly.

Unless she chose Jessica to have a more subtle influence to play the heroes against one another, which even then she had plenty of other Skrulls who could take this position, while she had a more powerful one.

Could anyone explain this to me?

Avengers and Beyond Vol 4 - Norman Osborn,"Hello! Assuming you didn't see my first post (I ain't judging), I just read all of Avengers Volume 4, which includes New, Young, Dark, Mighty, and more teams. I also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. I'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain Avengers in the coming days, though I won't get to all of them. Also, I should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! Hopefully that adds something to the post. It might be a lot, but I hope you enjoy!

\#1. Green Goblin  
In the midst of the Superhuman Civil War, the Thunderbolts program was initiated to bring villains under government control, allowing them to essentially function as lawmen. Norman Osborn, aka the Green Goblin is specifically utilized as the Registration leader Iron Man's own personal hitman. The first target Tony sends the Goblin after is a reporter named Ben Urich, who had begun uncovering financial secrets about Stark, mainly that his company had been greatly profiting off this Civil War. In hopes to ward Ben off the case, Tony sends the Green Goblin to attack him. \[1\] None of these threats seemed to work, and Urich was able to quickly deduce that this was not the Goblin acting on his own. Despite this, I don't believe much ever came of Urich's stories unfortunately if they did get published. During the war, for reasons I cannot remember, a great number of sleeper Atlanteans began reawakening. I believe one group of these even caused an act of terrorism somewhere, but that may have been later during Dark Reign. When the Avenger Wonder Man discovers this group of Atlanteans amassing, Iron Man chooses to take drastic action. He the Green Goblin to privately take care of this Atlantean matter as thoroughly and not connected to SHIELD as possible. \[2\] The Goblin trashes the Atlanteans, and unfortunately Wonder Man as well who was caught up in everything. The Atlantean threat is ended, and the Green Goblin seemingly goes free.

\#2. Gaining Power  
After the Civil War, possibly for his successful work for Stark, Norman Osborn is given a promotion to lead the Thunderbolts he once was a member of. Here, Osborn works to reform villains into heroes supposedly (probably not). This time proves quite beneficial for Norman, seemingly giving him control over his own mind again. When most heroes where distracted in the Savage Land during the Secret Invasion, Norman and his Thunderbolts work to save New York from invasion alongside whichever heroes were left. The rest of the heroes did eventually show up, but the army didn't fully surrender until their Queen was assassinated by none other than Norman Osborn. \[3\] This put Osborn in great standings with the media and public, and he was soon set to replace Stark as the new Head of National Security, including SHIELD, Stark's technology, and, surprisingly, the Avengers. Now in charge of the protecting everyone, Osborn renames SHIELD to HAMMER (for no real reason) and begins making his own Dark version of the Avengers. He offers membership to the current Mighty Avengers, but the majority refuse to work for the former villain. The only exceptions are Ares and Sentry, the latter of which suffers from psychological issues which allows Norman to relate to him. \[4\] Despite being able to sympathize with the Sentry, Norman works throughout his Dark Reign to gain control of both the Sentry and his alternate persona, the Void.

\#3. Dark Avengers  
With his Avengers roster found lacking, Norman begins filling up the members with members of his former Thunderbolts team. However, many of these members are well known villains, like Bullseye and Venom, so he gives each of them the mantles of well known heroes as disguises. Norman even takes up a new heroic guise of his own thanks to having access to loads of Stark's old armors. Needing a symbol of hope for the team, he paints Captain America colors on a more recent model of armor, calling himself the Iron Patriot! \[5\] Although Norman's Avengers may now look like heroes, they're all still villains at heart (except for Ares and Sentry), and they begin to cause nothing but trouble for him. Hawkeye (Bullseye) kills a civilian in front of a News Helicopter, Spider-Man (Venom) has been eating body parts off of random villains, and of course Norman can't have these hooligans disrupting his perfect image. Fortunately for him, Osborn is a master of Public Relations manipulation, and somehow he manages to avoid bad press every single time. In hopes to secure his power and gain more allies, Osborn assembles some of the most powerful like-minded people in the community, such as Doctor Doom, Loki, the Hood, and more. \[6\] This alliance is full of mistrust and mostly doesn't work, but there are a few instances where they come to one another's aid. One such instance involves Iron Patriot travelling back in time with Doctor Doom, similar to how Iron Man had done earlier in the Mighty Avengers title.

\#4. Breaking Down  
This Cabal of villains ultimately proves more trouble than it's worth for Norman. Loki in particular takes several major actions against Osborn in order to cause mischief, all the while pretending to still be his ally. Loki forms another team of Mighty Avengers, led by Henry Pym, who claims his team is the real Avengers team as he is the only founding member leading. Pym and his team infuriate Loki to no end, and all the while Loki is posing as the Green Goblin inside Norman's mind in hopes of shattering his psyche once again. One of Norman's big failures comes during the event known as Utopia, where the mutants attempt to separate from humanity to form their own community. In attempts to thwart this, Norman creates his own team of Dark X-Men to combat these mutants, but his allies from the Cabal Namor and Emma Frost turn against him, resulting in the mutants getting what they wish for. Despite this loss, PR master Norman Osborn flips things around for the media and plays this off a win to be rid of the mutants. \[7\] Osborn takes another HUGE hit to his mental state when the Dark Avengers encounter the villain known as the Molecule Man. In their attempts to stop the villain, each member of the Dark Avengers are placed into a kind of psychic prison, which proves immensely devastating to psychologically damaged people like the Iron Patriot or the Sentry. \[8\] Norman's right-hand lady Victoria Hand manages to talk the Molecule Man into surrender, and the day is seemingly saved.

\#5. How the Mighty Fall  
The Avengers' battle against the Molecule Man, alongside the disbanding of the Cabal, is essentially the breaking point for Norman, a moment which is capitalized on by Loki. \[9\] The god of mischief convinces Osborn that Asgard's current relocation to Earth proves to be a threat to the common people, and Norman is convinced he should strike against the Asgardians. He attempts to get permission from the President, though he is turned down and warned. But ever the PR master manipulator, Norman triggers an event involving the Asgardian known as Volstagg that results in immense loss of civilian lives. Without permission from the President, the Iron Patriot uses this as an excuse to strike against Asgard, assembling every possible force at his disposal to join in the fight. Things begin to go badly once Captain America arrives with every Avenger available. Iron Patriot's helmet is knocked off, revealing Green Goblin paint underneath. \[10\] As a last ditch effort, Osborn commands the Sentry to crash Asgard down to Earth, which he does. Sentry actually goes full Void here, threatening the lives of everyone present, though this is ended after Thor slays him. In the chaos, Norman attempts to flee, but is caught by Captain America. Osborn and his allies are arrested, the rights to Stark's tech and the Avengers' name are restored, and Captain America becomes the new Head of National Security, summoning in a new Heroic Age for the world.

"If the MCU got a reboot, which Avengers storys/villains would you like to see them do?","Purely hypothetical.

Let's say the MCU got a reboot, they do something like a phase 1 again, ironman, cap, Hulk, maybe this time they add antman and Wasp into the original avengers bla bla bla.

If they didn't want to reuse the same villains, so no Loki, Ultron or Thanos.. what villains would you want to see for Avenger films?

I was thinking of this and found coming up with any really difficult. Because sure, you could do Galactus, Apocalypse or Zemo. But these villains, like many others, require a ton of set up first. Like you can't really do Zemo without having The Avengers already be a team. You can't really do Galactus without the Fantastic 4.

Anyway, who would you like to see? Or better yet, which stories would you like to see be adapted that the MCU still hasn't done?",Marvel,0,0.33

Spider-Man vs Batman,"All rounds are bloodlusted

No plot armor BS. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves

Round 1: Base to base. Spider-Man is in his regular everyday suit, no special armor or weapons. Batman has standard gear like his utility belt and other little stuff he carries around regular when fighting crime. They know nothing of each others abilities prior the fight

Round 2: They both get 1 month prep-time with full knowledge of each other‚Äôs abilities. They can bring whatever equipment necessary to incapacitate or kill the other opponent.

R1: What is there to really settle about this. Spider-Man will speed blitz and one shot Batman. Spider-Man is just so physically superior to Batman in every way. Batman has the advantage when it comes to BIQ and Combat Skill, but that stuff don‚Äôt matter when you are physically outclassed by 1000%. (I feel that Peter has as good as, if not higher IQ than Batman)

R1: Batman would most likely win based off what I‚Äôve seen. However, let‚Äôs not downplay Peter. Even if you feel Batman is smarter than Peter, Peter is still one of the smartest characters in Marvel. We have seen time and time again that Peter is able to formulate multi-step plans to take down. Batman honestly only wins because of the ‚Äúany equipment you want part‚Äù. If he pulls out the Hellbat suit, it‚Äôs most likely wraps for Peter. However, Peter is very smart and has been shown to make amazing technology by himself. For all we know, he could make something to counter the Hellbat. However, we haven‚Äôt really seen such a thing. So for right now, Batman stomps.

Lmk what yall think. If you have any disagreements, please feel free to let me know. However, provide something to back it up. Keep in mind, I‚Äôve only read a little of their comics so excuse me if I get some stuff mixed up or incorrect.",Marvel,0,0.08

This movie (Hulk vs Wolverine) proved Deadpool can be very well done in a PG-13 setting ,"Lots of folks, due to the live-action films, seem to think Deadpool can‚Äôt possibly be done justice we‚Äôre he to be portrayed in a project that isn‚Äôt rated R. I think that‚Äôs just plain wrong. Deadpool in the comics isn‚Äôt as vulgar as his film adaptation and he‚Äôs still plenty funny. He also appears in other characters‚Äô issues and isn‚Äôt as foul-mouthed or violent as he usually is, and he‚Äôs still very funny and a great addition. This animated movie helps prove that. The worst he says is ‚Äúdammit‚Äù and Deadpool is still hilarious in this. He‚Äôs zany and just a complete goof amidst a very violent and otherwise serious setting. One could say the issue of gore would be an issue, as Deadpool is known for getting ripped apart in exceedingly gruesome ways for comedy‚Äôs sake, but you can still pull off things like dismemberment and beheadings in PG-13 just fine. It‚Äôs been shown many times before.

Avengers and Beyond Vol 4 - Ares,"Hello! Assuming you didn't see my first post (I ain't judging), I just read all of Avengers Volume 4, which includes New, Young, Dark, Mighty, and more teams. I also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. I'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain Avengers in the coming days, though I won't get to all of them. Also, I should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! Hopefully that adds something to the post. It might be a lot, but I hope you enjoy!

\#1. Thor Plus Wolverine  
After the Superhuman Civil War, Iron Man is placed in charge of National Security, including SHIELD. And together with Ms. Marvel, these heroes form a new team of Mighty Avengers by picking the best of the best from all available heroes. There were several roles they wanted filled, two of which being a ""Thor"" (god power) and a ""Wolverine"" (ready to kill if the need arose). Fortunately, Ms. Marvel knew just the person. The duo approaches Ares, the Olympian god of war and several time Avengers foe. \[1\] Despite their history, Ares accepts their offer, partially because he's impressed by Iron Man's insistence, but also so that he can provide a better life for his Earth-born son Alex. The Olympian immediately proves useful during a battle against giant Subterranean monsters, but particularly useful in the Mighty Avengers' battle against Ultron. The android takes over Tony Stark's biotech armor, reshaping his physical form to that of the Wasp (Ultron's ""mother""). Doctor Henry Pym is called in as an Ultron expert, and he develops a virus that should separate Ultron from Iron Man's biology. However, this virus needed to be specifically injected inside Ultron/Stark's body. Ares volunteers for the project, and he proves an excellent candidate thanks to his durability and battle skills as he fights against the robotic antibodies within. \[2\] Though they nearly overwhelm him, Ares is rescued by the Wasp, and the pair escapes before Ultron goes BOOM.

\#2. Son of War  
The goes on many more missions, battling against symbiotes and Doctor Doom. The team is approached by Jessica Jones and her child who needed help, and Ares adorably melted as soon as the baby arrived, presumably with memories of his own son. And speaking of Ares' son Alex, some time around now Nick Fury reaches out to Alex. Fury recruits the boy for his team of Secret Warriors, kind of a secret spy group loyal to Fury, and Ares is not made aware of this. Even during the Secret Invasion, Alex, Fury, and the Secret Warriors are out on the front lines battling while Ares and his team are off in the Savage Land dealing with their own thing. The Mighty Avengers do eventually return, but even up until the end Ares does not discover his son's actions with Fury. The Secret Invasion does finally end though when a man known as Norman Osborn assassinates the Queen of the Skrulls, and this man is celebrated as a war hero that even Ares admires the accomplishments of. Because of his heroism, the US government appoints Norman as the new Director of SHIELD (soon renamed HAMMER) and National Security. This role gives Osborn the rights to the Avengers name, and he extends membership to the current Mighty Avengers. Ares in one of the only two to join alongside Sentry as he admires Norman as stated earlier. \[3\]

\#3. Team Shade  
Despite his initial admiration, Ares slowly begins to see the seedier side of Osborn as time goes on and the Dark Avengers go on more missions. And while he's on the Dark Avengers, Ares finally discovers that his son Alex is working for Nick Fury. One day, ""on his way to school"", Alex is followed by Ares, who confronts Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors. \[4\] There is a brief battle, but Fury and Ares come to an understanding, and the god of war permits his son to work for Fury as long as Nick makes sure Alex is not harmed. So around now, Osborn sees an opportunity before himself. He happens to be in charge of HAMMER, the most prestigious group of combat trained agents in possibly the whole world, and he also has the Olympian god of war on his payroll. Norman gives Ares his own personal pick of all the HAMMER agents so that he can create the most effective team of elite agents possible. \[5\] Ares assembles a small band of men, and they are soon put to the test when Ares hears word from his mother Hera that his son has been injured and put in danger, which goes directly against his deal with Fury. The group breaks into the SHIELD base where they believe Alex is being held, but they soon realize they were mistaken upon their arrival. It is not Alex who was in peril, but another of Ares' sons named Kyknos, and he hopes to kill his father Ares to become the new god of war. A battle of immortal proportions ensues, which kills not only Kyknos, but also the men from Ares' elite squad. \[6\]

\#4. Gods and Monsters  
In the final days of this volume, Osborn begins planning a Siege on the immortal nation of Asgard, which has temporarily been displaced to Midgard/Earth. Osborn wants them gone and he needs the aid of his own personal immortal to make the battle successful. By his nature, Ares is greatly opposed to this plan, as the Asgardians are a highly honored people among the gods. He initially refuses to aid Osborn in his attack, even threatening to stop him if need be. \[7\] However, Norman is a master of manipulation, and through deception he ultimately convinces Ares to reluctantly lead his armies alongside him. Not too much time goes by before the strike against Asgard begins, and Ares fights with all his might as you would expect from the god of war. Things change when Ares is informed of Norman's deception. The god is enraged, and he immediately goes to attack Osborn for tricking him into committing such a despicable act. \[8\] Unfortunately for Ares, Osborn also has the Sentry on his side, and the Sentry has been manipulated into becoming his fully out of control Void self. Before Ares gets to Norman, Sentry/Void is instructed to protect him, and in this confrontation between Ares and Sentry, Ares is torn in half and perishes at his former ally's hand. (Google the image. It's epic, but I'm having trouble with the Auto-Mod already and don't want this post taken down.) Osborn and the Void are defeated, summoning a new Heroic Age, but at the cost of the life of an Avenger.

Question about Wolverine's immortality.,"So is Logan immortal or just has a real streak of longevity? 

Background to this so my friends were arguing that Wolverine can't be immortal because Hugh Jackman is getting older. And that because Jackman is getting older, it proves that eventually Logan will die. Of course, the basic problem with this, is that Hugh Jackman is a human being and not a comic book character. Whereas Logan from the comics is fictitious and can be young or old or whatever the writer wants. 

So within the main Universe, excluding Old Man Logan, excluding weird alternate futures, is Wolverine immortal? Could he theoretically live forever, or is there a set time limit baked into his character/ X-Gene such as his body will break down after say 2,000 years and it's inevitable?

I'm probably not going to be able to settle the argument with my friends since they can't get over the incontrovertible fact that Hugh Jackman aging has nothing to do with the character aging. But it will put my own mind at rest if I could just hear what folks think overall.",Marvel,1,0.57

Getting back into it after 15 years. Have questions.,"The last time I read comics was around the time of Spider-Man‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne More Day‚Äù and X-men‚Äôs ‚ÄúMessiah Complex‚Äù

I don‚Äôt have too many questions about specific runs or characters, just about comics in general. I picked up the three issues of Ultimate Spider-Man, love them so far. I saw the ultimate universe got a soft reboot and it felt like the perfect time to jump in. Already watched a nice summary of the maker and what set up this new ultimate universe.  

Now for my questions. 

Should I read all the new ultimates if I want the complete story? If yes, how do I do this cost effectively? 

Are Black Panther and X-men the only other ones currently? Will more be added? (Hoping to see Father Murdock as Ultimate DD)

What‚Äôs the difference between 1st/2nd/3rd prints? Is it just the cover art? Are 1st prints more coveted?

Outside of the ultimates, any quick recommendations? Spider-Man and X-men were what I read most in the past, but am more open to other stuff now. Doesn‚Äôt have to be marvel but it doesn‚Äôt hurt.

"Question, Has Venom ever acted as a Wingman in a dating situation in the Comics?","So, I'm reading a fanfic (I know, I know) where Venom has bonded with Harry Potter (I Know).  This particular Venom is based off the Sony movies. Having not seen them, I still really enjoying the characterization.  Sort of a cross between a violently protective big brother and a proud parent (both mother and father).

Something that came to mind was if there had every been a point in the comics where Venom acted as a solid wingman for his host?

As a follow up, is there a point where Venom acts like described above towards his host?",Marvel,0,0.27
What are some story arcs you feel aren't talked about enough?,"There are many story arcs that receive either unanimous praise, or are otherwise constantly talked about: Infinity Gauntlet, Surtur Saga, Dark Phoenix, Civil War, Annihilation, Secret Wars, etc.

While these stories are certainly more than worthy of the discussion they've garnered, Marvel Comics is *long*. There are hundreds, even thousands of story arcs across its 80 years of history. 

What are some story arcs that you feel are underrated and should be talked about more?

&amp;#x200B;

My example would be Thor's ""War of the Pantheons"" arc from #383-400. While the first bit of this arc was rough, once it got started it was really exciting. The story is about Seth, the Egyptian God of Death, stealing the power of the whole Egyptian Pantheon and launching of invasion of Asgard after it was crippled in the war against Surtur. You see Balder as regent trying to hold everything together, Thor going on a good old fashioned quest, meet the Celtic pantheon, Seth feels like a genuinely menacing villain, and all together I think it's just one of Marvel's best ""war arcs.""",Marvel,12,0.79

Fantastic Four 90s Cartoon Alt Universe,"Reposting this from a while back as I feel it‚Äôs more relevant.

Fantastic 4 and Spider-Man were set in different universes in the Marvel Animated Universe (1990s)

In the Fantastic Four episode ""Nightmare in Green"", Scarlet Spider appears under an overhang watching Rick Jones and Human Torch fly by. This was because at the time of the series' production Ben was the primary Spider-Man and Peter was retired. However, this makes no sense within the Marvel Animated Universe as Ben never appeared in the primary universe, until ‚ÄúI Really, Really Hate Clones‚Äù. The logical explanation is that the Fantastic Four show is set in the same universe the Scarlet Spider comes from and subsequently the Peter Parker from the animated series has to save.

I am aware that the Fantastic Four do appear in Secret Wars , but they could just be similar alternative versions. This also explains why Spider-Man wasn‚Äôt affected by the arrival of Galactus. Also their costumes are different.

Avengers and Beyond Vol 4 - Spider-Women,"Hello! Assuming you didn't see my first post (I ain't judging), I just read all of Avengers Volume 4, which includes New, Young, Dark, Mighty, and more teams. I also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. I'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain Avengers in the coming days, though I won't get to all of them. Also, I should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! Hopefully that adds something to the post. It might be a lot, but I hope you enjoy! I should also mention that this and the Hank Pym posts are the only ones I've had to re-upload due to Auto-Mod interference, so maybe they have something against Skrull imposters. Anyway...

\#1. Secret Agent  
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a group of alien Skrulls prophesied a day of great destruction for their people, as well as a blue beacon of hope on another planet. Something like that, they didn't get into it too much to where I remembered great detail. This group was lead by a Skrull woman named Veranke, but her and her people were cast out for their prophecies. \[1\] One day, however, the force of nature known as Galactus showed up at the Skrull's homeworld and had a big yummy meal, which meant their primary world was as good as dead. Skrulls all began to realize that the prophecies of Veranke and her group were truth, and she was soon elected Queen of the Skrull Empire. As new leader of the Skrulls, Veranke set her sights on Secretly Invading the great blue planet Earth so her people could make it their new homeworld. Using data gathered from when a group called the Illuminati attempted to threaten them, the Skrulls began replacing Earthlings one by one, perfectly replicating both their memories as well as any superpowers they may have had while becoming completely undetectable by any type of science, magic, or seemingly anything. Some agents were even given the powers of multiple heroes to become Super-Skrulls, but we don't see much of these agents until a little later on. Veranke herself desired to get involved, wanting a role that would cause the most damage. The Earthling known as Jessica Drew, aka Spider-Woman, was selected due to her ties with both SHIELD and Hydra. \[2\] As Jessica, Veranke had a rare close relationship with the ultra-secretive Nick Fury, former Director of SHIELD and current wanted outlaw. Working for Nick, Veranke worked for both Hydra and SHIELD as a double-agent for both, but truly only answering to Fury.

\#2. Alien Avenger  
During a tour or something (not super explained) of the Raft, superhuman SHIELD Agent Jessica Drew is assigned to escort Luke Cage, Matt Murdock, and Foggy Nelson to the lower areas of the superhuman prison known as the Raft. Not long after these guests arrive, however, a complete blackout occurs, allowing all of the villains held here to break out. Heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Iron Man soon arrive to help our heroes, and soon the breakout is quelled. Several villains manage to escape, but the day is mostly saved. This event inspires Captain America to assemble a new team of Avengers, and he asks Jessica/Veranke to be one of the members. Already tied up with SHIELD and Hydra, as well as her own Skrull schemes, she checks in with the likes of Madame Hydra and Nick Fury before accepting. When both nerds want their own mole in the Avengers, Jessica agrees to join these New Avengers. \[3\] Here she ""reunites"" with an old friend, Jessica Jones, who is currently in a relationship with Luke Cage. Though she is now an Avenger, Veranke still has meetings in secret with her fellow Skrull agents. Anywho, Spider-Woman and the Avengers make it their mission to recover those villains who escaped from the Raft that night. They head to the Savage Land to recover Sauron, and while there they discover a splinter group of SHIELD agents stealing resources from the area. These rogue agents are locked away by the Avengers, aided by Wolverine who joins the team, and it's never discovered that these rogue agents were actually Skrulls in disguise.

\#3. Everything Goes Wrong  
Next, the New Avengers head to Japan to recapture Silver Samurai, who seems to be renewing his relationship with the villainous Madame Hydra. The Avengers arrive and defeat both villains, but let Silver Samurai go free when it's discovered the Raft had faked his death and were keeping him unlawfully. Still, the Avengers do get to go back with Madame Hydra in tow. Spider-Woman is still attempting to be heroic, but is forced to free Madame Hydra in order to keep her cover. \[4\] She almost gets away with it too, if it wasn't for that meddling Captain America, who catches a glimpse of what Jessica did. The next day, while at breakfast, Steve confronts her about this and why she freed Madame Hydra. Getting the OK from Fury, she informs Cap and the rest of the Avengers about her messy alliances with both SHIELD and Hydra, though chooses to keep her little green secret to herself. The Avengers find it harder to trust her now, but seem to understand and keep her on their team. Later, after a meeting between the Avengers and the X-Men, both teams head off to find the Scarlet Witch. Before they arrive, reality is reset into a world where mutants rule as a majority. Mutants are one of the biggest problems that the Skrulls faced as part of their infiltration, so this sudden change is devastating to invasion plans. Though most heroes don't seem to recall this change, the Skrull agents do. Veranke has a meeting with Skrull agent Criti-Noll, who is disguised as Yellowjacket, and the two discuss their options. \[5\] They agree to let this play out and pray that reality reverts to how it was, trusting the heroes of Earth to fix everything while planning to assassinate the Witch. The heroes manage to fix things without Wanda's death, and as the reality they knew returns, the Scarlet Witch who was responsible for this also greatly decreases the amount of mutants on Earth. This result is an immense step forward for the Skrulls' invasion plans, though the Annihilation Wave is a huge loss for their people.

\#4. Secret No More  
The Superhuman Civil War shatters the remainder of Earth's heroes, splitting the super community in half. Tony Stark and Maria Hill (current Director of SHIELD) attempt to trick Spider-Woman with a Life Model Decoy of Nick Fury, hoping to get her to reveal the location of Nick Fury. \[6\] Jess sees through this and escapes after a Hydra attack, joining up with the outlaw heroes and remaining with their Avengers team when the war comes to an end. Initially unsure of what to do next, the New Avengers soon decide to rescue their ally Maya Lopez, who they had left behind in Japan so she could continue monitoring criminal activities over there. They discover Maya had been captured by the Hand and brainwashed so she fought the Avengers alongside the Hand. The Avengers helped free her, and as revenge, Echo kills the Hand's leader Elektra. Elektra falls to the ground, revealing that she had been a Skrull imposter this whole time. Realizing the invasion has begun, the New Avengers can no longer trust one another, and Veranke is absolutely shaking in her boots, though remaining as collected as she needs to be to keep her cover. At first opportunity, she makes a run for it with the Skrull Elektra corpse, bringing it directly to Iron Man, the new Director of SHIELD after Maria Hill. \[7\] Now both the New Avengers and the Mighty Avengers are disrupted, which is only helped when Tony offers Jessica a place on his team. After a few weeks, Spider-Woman is confronted by Wolverine directly. By the end, he's somewhat convinced that she's not a Skrull, but dashes when her teammate Black Widow shows up. Not much comes from this encounter, but both Iron Man and Wolverine seem convinced she's human.

\#5. Out with the New, In with the Old  
When Stark hears reports of a Skrull ship landing in the Savage Land, he and his team head out there to investigate. Veranke makes sure the outlaw Avengers are also made aware, and both teams arrive on the scene. A slew of heroes pour out of the Skrull ship claiming to be the original versions. Before the confrontation, all of Stark's tech shuts off at once (thanks to the Hank Pym Skrull from before). Ms. Marvel hides Tony away in a cave to recover, so Veranke uses this moment to take advantage of Tony's moment of weakness. She attempts to trick him, convincing Stark that he has been a high-up Skrull leader all this time. \[8\] She fails to convince him however, and she's scared off by several Avengers who have discovered how to tell who is and isn't a Skrull. While these Skrulls had been keeping our heroes busy, an army of Super-Skrulls had begun invading New York, which is where Veranke heads next. The heroes arrive, turning the tides, and making the Skrull invaders desperate. After their last ditch effort plan is foiled, Veranke is taken down for good by Norman Osborn, which seems to end the invasion. \[9\] Iron Man locates the captives held by the Skrulls, and Jessica Drew is returned to Earth. Wolverine invites the real Jessica to take house with the outlaw Avengers, though there is some initial pushback. Wolvie reminds his teammates that Jess isn't the Skrull Queen any more, and their tone soon shifts as they can't judge her for the Skrull's actions. After Jess joins, she risks her life as part of a plot to lure the Dark Avengers out into a trap, but the trap turns on the Avengers when Osborn sends the Hood's men after her instead. The Avengers make it out of this ambush just barely thanks to a combo attack with Jess and Ms. Marvel. There was also a cool plot where she teamed up with Spider-Man, even briefly battling him when Mandrill took over her mind. But she broke free of his control with Spider-Man's help and kicked his butt, and that's really about all till the end of the volume. \[10\]

"Does X-Men ‚Äò97 Stand Alone? In Other Words, Can It Be Someone‚Äôs First X-Media?","I‚Äôve been thinking about this ever since last week‚Äôs phenomenal episode. X-Men ‚Äò97 has quickly become a GOAT comics show for me, along with the 90‚Äôs DCAU. But where those DC shows can stand on there own as an intro to those characters, even with no familiarity with the comics, I don‚Äôt think the same can be said of X-Men ‚Äò97 and that‚Äôs unfortunate, if unavoidable.

X97 is a direct continuation of a much lesser show that has 5 seasons of kiddie cornball tv production stories. A person who has never seen or read anything X-Men is probably not going to be moved to watch it, nor should they. But a familiarity with these characters in some form does seem to be a prerequisite for 97, if nothing else. Going into the show knowing the basic relationships, struggles, histories, etc.

This problem came to my mind as I was considering whether a friend would enjoy ‚Äò97. She doesn‚Äôt read comics or watch comic book movies and she was born in 98, so way after the 90s cartoons were relevant and even too young to be much aware of the early 00‚Äôs comic book movie boom. But, she has been getting into watching animation lately. She really loved both of the Spider-Verse films and she recently saw Paprika and loved that too. 

I think she would dig ‚Äò97 if she could follow it but I also think she would be totally lost. I know she won‚Äôt read the comics or watch the old show. I‚Äôm not even sure I could get her to sit through the original movies, or if I‚Äôd even want her too because they are all pretty dated and, IMO, inferior to 97. Don‚Äôt want to scare her off the idea!

What do you think about the idea that Mutants are essentially Eternals now?,"Basically what I mean by this is that in the past, mutants were portrayed as ‚Äúminorities‚Äù amongst humans. Obviously racial, civil rights allegory, everyone already knows about it no need to go into detail.

What they‚Äôve done recently is now mutants are now Demi gods. Like, as a whole. They don‚Äôt need to be accepted by humanity because they‚Äôre better in every way. They‚Äôre even better than other non-mutant heroes it seems like. Yeah there‚Äôs always been a hand full of mutants that could cause an extinction level event like Scarlett Witch(when they feel like calling her a mutant again), Mad Jim Jaspers, Franklin Richards(when they feel like calling him a mutant again), Legion, Phoenix etc‚Ä¶.

But recently it appears that the edict at Marvel is that mutants as a whole are to the level of Gods. Hell I‚Äôm pretty sure the X-Men could pull off a win against Asgard if they  needed to and it wouldn‚Äôt be controversial. ",Marvel,0,0.37

But ultimately it introduced me to some of my favorites, like Miles Morales and Kamala Khan.

I'm a Sentry fan, surprise, and I honestly believe both versions had promise if one writer would have bold enough to explore the reality of them way more than the few issues they shown up respectively.

* Death Seed Sentry was basically Sentry without the Void AKA full potential mode. Stable and ""healthy"". Strong enough to hold 50% of the weight of Exitar, the celestial executioner and move it's corpse away from earth.
* Merged Sentry was....we actually don't know as it seemed like he constantly battles with the Void inside when IMO it supposed to be a version where there is no more Sentry or Void or Robert as separate entities. Anyway he was way more OP than ever before (one shotting Carol and Thor, incapaciting She-Hulk).",Marvel,6,0.88

Most Awkward Hug in The History of The Planet,,Marvel,2,1.0
Would you guys accept newsprint if it meant cheaper and bigger comics?,"So I think one thing we all agree on is that sometimes comics can be a bit on the expensive side. Especially if you want to follow an entire line of books like the X-Men. Which makes sense considering the quality of the paper they're printed on. 

But let's ask a hypothetical. If Marvel switched back to newsprint paper, which is relatively cheaper to print, about 48 pages per issue, and price at about $1.99 USD, would you guys be down for it?

I would be. I think each individual issue being twice as big can help with some of the pacing issues some modern comics have. And producing it on cheaper paper would help keep the cost of each issue reasonable. 

Plus, with comics being priced at two dollars an issue, that's 10 comics for just $20. You can't tell me that's not a good deal.

I got other ideas for alternate publishing methods I think Marvel could employ.",Marvel,7,0.82
Who do you think are the current members of the Avengers of Earth-1048?,"I personally think at the moment (as of Spider-Man 2) the current roster is Thor(Jane Foster), Vision, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther (Current chair person), and Wasp.

My headcanon is that Cap‚Äôs off with Falcon looking for Bucky at the moment, Captain Marvel is off with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor is M.I.A after Ragnarok so Jane is currently wielding Mjolnir.

There has been a few characters who have had a bad live action showing. Now I'm a huge Dr Doom fan, and that was bad, but at least he had a pretty good mask.

But Apocalypse... what in the blue blazing hell was that!!! If you were to put that movie on mute, would you even know who the hell that was. EVERYONE ELSE looks relatively comic accurate. They looked different but I new who Archangel was. Nightcrawler is a tricky character to bring to live action but they got it done. Unless you know X Men lore you wouldn't get the pyramid thing. 

So, who do you think needs a redo? ",Marvel,443,0.95

"Eric the Red, aka the Kang Hunter. ","In an alternate timeline Thor Odinson and Wanda Maximoff, aka The Scarlet Witch, were lovers and had a child named Eric Thorson with fiery red hair and a mischievous glint in his eye. 

Shortly after Eric's birth his parents were killed by a version of Kang the Conqueror but the boy was saved by his Uncle Loki. 

Loki with the help of the Enchantress raised Eric with the idea of revenge. How better to take revenge against Kang and his well ordered timeline than to introduce a new god of chaos? 

Learning how to use his vast potential from his Uncle Loki and growing up under the watchful gaze and doting attentions of the Enchantress, Eric grew to usurp Chthon and claim the title god of chaos. 

It was after that victory that Kang fearing him simply weeded that entire timeline out of existence. 

Eric barely managed to escape to the 616 timeline, where he is significantly less powerful but just as hateful towards every version of Kang and any tyrant who would impose a strict order over others. 

Now under the name Eric the Red a new hero has causing disasters for the plans of would be oppressors and sowing the seeds of chaos and freedom to rebuild his power and hunt his prey.
