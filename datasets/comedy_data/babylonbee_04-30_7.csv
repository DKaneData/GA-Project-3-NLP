Babylon Bee is not satire,"The Babylon Bee is not satire and here's why. Satire, by its very definition, makes truthful observations about society. Its purpose is to mock bad things like dishonesty, corruption, hypocrisy, and so forth. It only works when the premise of the observation is true.

The Bee does not make truthful observations about society. Here's an example:

Pennsylvania Election Audit Shows Benjamin Franklin Voted For Biden

The premise of the joke that article makes is ""Democrats only won the 2020 election because they committed massive voter fraud"". That premise is a lie. It is a partisan lie told by Republicans who want to discredit a legitimate election that they lost. Here's another example:

After Resigning For Sexual Harassment, Cuomo Immediately Hired By CNN

The only reason why the Bee picked CNN as its target here is because they dislike CNN on a partisan level. CNN has never been credibly accused of having an organizational culture that tolerates sexual misconduct.

But you know which network has? Fox. In recent years, both Fox's CEO (Roger Ailes) and highest rated anchor (Bill O'Reilly) were forced to resign due to sexual misconduct. So the Bee could have made a joke with a truthful premise if they had replaced CNN with Fox in the article. But they didn't, because they're only interested in attacking their partisan enemies. They have no desire to mock Fox for anything because Fox acts as propaganda for the Bee's preferred partisan allies.

In conclusion, satire cannot come from a place of partisan agendas. It has to attack absurdity no matter where it lies. That is not what the Babylon Bee does. The Bee only exists to push its preferred partisan narrative, and so it ignores dishonesty, hypocrisy, and corruption when it comes from the Bee's partisan allies. That's why its not satire.",babylonbee,0,0.29

Why did adam leave BB and start NtB?,"Hey, I am not a member here, I came here to see more info on the Bee exodus that seems to be happening right now. It prompted another question...

I know Adam started and then sold most of the Bee, and I read his public reasons that generally seemed a matter of principle on the clickbait/social media aspect of it.

What doesn't make sense is that he then when and started Not The Bee, which seems WAY more clickbaity and way more right-wing. Is there something I'm missing? Not a big deal just seems weird.",babylonbee,6,1.0

"On the Ethan news, let's not react in haste.","There are some worrisome signs in the way things have happened so far.

But it's important to remember the human and that the Bee actually is still a relatively small organization which may have never had to undergo this kind of shakeup before. Expect things to be handled less than ideally.

It's easy to criticize from the outside and form an opinion, but we do not know everything yet. 

I'm not interested in taking definitive sides at this time. I hope some of y'all will join me.",babylonbee,10,0.78
