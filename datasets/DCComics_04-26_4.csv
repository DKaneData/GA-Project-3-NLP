Damian Wayne Question,Started reading Grant Morrison’s Black Glove.  I think this is the first introduction for Damian?  I couldn’t get through it though.  Felt pretty disjointed and I just wasn’t into it.  I’m kind of excited for the new “Boy Wonder” series that’s coming out in May and I’m wondering if I really need a lot of context for Damian’s story?

"Where to watch Young Justice season 2, 3 and 4 in Australia?","I live in Australia and only season 1 is on Stan.

I found season 2 on 123Movies with 720p which is better but I'm just trying to find it with better quality overall. Of course, if 123Movies is the best quality I can get I'll absolutely take it but I want to at least ask if anyone knows anywhere else?",DCcomics,2,0.67

So just out of curiosity. This just came to me. Respawn from the comics I don't normally read the comments just summaries of stories I find on places like screen rant etc.,"So to my understanding respawn was created from the spliced DNA of Talia and Deathstroke to be the perfect supersoldier. but what would happen if there was more than two DNA donors?

Hypothetically speaking what if it was Superman. Wonder woman. Batman. Flash. Hawk girl and Ra's himself. Would he end up making an abomination with all of their spliced DNA or would he make respawn but with not all of the abilities from all of the DNA donors?

This has been on my mind ever since I started thinking about Superboy and how he is a clone of lex and Superman but earlier I saw a post about how Superboy doesn't seem to have the same intelligence as lex luthor? So. With the spliced DNA of multiple people would Respawn be an omnipotent being in a way or just an abomination with no point to exist?",DCcomics,0,0.27

Volume 1 has 53 issues, NTT has 58 issues before it starts going into reprints, New Titans has 130, Dan Jurgens has 24, early 2000's has 50, Johns to Flashpoint has 100, New 52 has 30 and 24...and then things get tricky with Rebirth where we have a Titans and Teen Titans running side by side? Just going with the longer running of the two gives us  47, and I guess we can also count Academy for 15 issues because there was no other book coming out with it? And finally Taylor's run currently has 10, so that gives the total of 541.

If I Were to Restart the DC Cinematic Universe ,"Edit: a quick Google search has shown me that James Gunn is already doing a thing with this so this whole post is kind of moot.

Preface: I am not commenting on any of the movies, I am not offering opinions on any of that or anything that might start controversy; this is merely the musings of a madman, albeit, a madman that wishes to remain polite and courteous to their fellow redditors. It’s also worth mentioning that I am not up to date on the last ten years of comics and the last 5 years of DC movies. 

I digress.

If I were going to restart the DC films, I would open up with a Booster Gold movie. 

Why? 

He’s obscure enough that most casual fans don’t know who he is — and I think that works to everyone’s artistic benefit. Less preconceived notions on the audience’s behalf going in. Some people might not even know he’s from
DC, without the branding. 

He has an amazing redemption arc in the form of Rip Hunter’s lackey in keeping the timeline secure.  Plus, his existence really makes it easy to lean into any of the 52/multiverse stuff if they wanted to. 

And, because his origin story leaves a pretty large opportunity to establish a cinematic franchise/the potential rosters of the JLA. 

For those not hip to BG: he’s from the future and a washed up jock working at a museum, until he steals a bunch of old superhero tech from the museum, travels into the past to modern times to establish an overly commercial identity as a superhero. Naturally, he does every bit of product placement you could imagine. The other heroes hate him for it — but that’s also why he was chosen to help keep the timelime secure… because nobody would suspect he would be trusted with such a responsibility. 

I dunno, I think it would be a really easy film to write and something that wouldn’t take itself too seriously. I’m sure someone else has pitched this before.

Girly Cassie or tomboyish Cassie? ,"
Lately I’ve been reading myself a bit into some different young justice comics.
I also looked into a lot of fanart as well.

I stumbled upon that Cassandra sandsmarks/wonder girl had quiet the tomboyish look in the 90s comics.
 
Personally I really like the idea of Cassie being quiet the tomboy when she was younger and later on around high school/college embraces her femininity more. I had been through the same thing so I guess I can kinda relate to it.

"What is the best Green Lantern book to read, set prior to its Dawn of DC era? aka is it Grant Morrison's The Green Lantern?","So I've been plotting my return to comics via graphic novels regarding certain characters. And I have a system in place, sorta speak (more accidental), that involves getting a story(ies) that happened before the ""main point"". I know this makes no sense, so I'll try to explain in detail.

For Superman, it was Warworld; the epic saga that was the best Superman story in years, and it help guide me to his current era with the relaunch and Dawn of DC directive of Superman and Action Comics. For Batman, it was Joker War that sets up the current status quo of the character; for Wonder Woman, it was Trial of the Amazons, and for The Flash, the One Minute War.

For Green Lantern, its...well, thats the point of this topic.

I asked recently about Dark Crisis, and everyone said to skip it. Now part of the reason why I was curious about that event was its explanation toward Earth being quarantine, and its connection to Green Lantern with the Corps and Oa, etc. But the fact that its skippable means to just go into GL's Dawn of DC era with no issues, and after reading issue 1, I see alot has changed but easy to follow. 

Still, is there something else to get instead?

Looking at everything Green Lantern prior to Dark Crisis/Dawn of DC, I think the answer might be Grant Morrison's The Green Lantern. I don't recall any negative reactions toward his run, and my research is suggesting no issues that would affect me either. 

Question is: is his title the answer, or am I missing something? Another title that I missed or perhaps didn't think was important, but is the answer.

My Idea to justify why Batman doesn't kill the joker,"The fact that the joker still survive despite everything he has done is 

Gouvernment hates superheroes. They need them to deal with Big problems, sure. But they can't control them. A superhero like superman is seen a danger to the legitimity of the authority. There is also the fact their intérests almost always clashs . To simplify things, If superheroes in général are neutral good, politicians are lawful neutral or lawful evil (the majority are lawful evil)

So the reason why military programs to take down superheroes and teams like the suicide squad exist. They just need a good reason  justify hunting down the classic super-heros and replace them with their american-sanctionned supers

With this. The question we need to Ask now is no longer ""why Batman doesn't kill the joker"" but ""why no one else including cops or the justice system is dealing with him"" ""why does he goes to an Asylum despite the fact he isn't crazy enough to benifice of the insanity plea ?"" 

The answer is simple: he's a bait. One day Batman will kill him which will be a good enough reason to hunt him down, stop him and/or kill him and replace him with superheroes 100% loyal to the american gouvernment. The kind that would Never disobey and Always follow orders .
The kind that would restore and maintain order in Gotham (in a incredibly fascist and corrupted way I mean)

More serious portrayal of Robin,"Good evening my gentlemans. I started watching Titans not that far ago and I will post my thoughts about it when I finish with the first season, but for now I have a single question. #Which Batman story portrays Robin so cool and serious simmilar to the one in the series? 

I  never thinked of Robin that way but as a funny iritating sidekick so this series was a nice suprise for me.  Don't get me wron , I have read ""3 Jokers"" as well   ""Court of Owls"" and both Nightwing and Red Hood were so well written, but I am talking about their Robin time in perticuialr. 

 So could you please help me about this? I am deeply thankful. 
Once again I wish you an pleasent evening.",DCcomics,0,0.38
