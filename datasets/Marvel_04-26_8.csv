Fantastic Four 90s Cartoon Alt Universe,"Reposting this from a while back as I feel it‚Äôs more relevant.

Fantastic 4 and Spider-Man were set in different universes in the Marvel Animated Universe (1990s)

In the Fantastic Four episode ""Nightmare in Green"", Scarlet Spider appears under an overhang watching Rick Jones and Human Torch fly by. This was because at the time of the series' production Ben was the primary Spider-Man and Peter was retired. However, this makes no sense within the Marvel Animated Universe as Ben never appeared in the primary universe, until ‚ÄúI Really, Really Hate Clones‚Äù. The logical explanation is that the Fantastic Four show is set in the same universe the Scarlet Spider comes from and subsequently the Peter Parker from the animated series has to save.

I am aware that the Fantastic Four do appear in Secret Wars , but they could just be similar alternative versions. This also explains why Spider-Man wasn‚Äôt affected by the arrival of Galactus. Also their costumes are different.

Avengers and Beyond Vol 4 - Spider-Women,"Hello! Assuming you didn't see my first post (I ain't judging), I just read all of Avengers Volume 4, which includes New, Young, Dark, Mighty, and more teams. I also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. I'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain Avengers in the coming days, though I won't get to all of them. Also, I should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! Hopefully that adds something to the post. It might be a lot, but I hope you enjoy! I should also mention that this and the Hank Pym posts are the only ones I've had to re-upload due to Auto-Mod interference, so maybe they have something against Skrull imposters. Anyway...

\#1. Secret Agent  
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a group of alien Skrulls prophesied a day of great destruction for their people, as well as a blue beacon of hope on another planet. Something like that, they didn't get into it too much to where I remembered great detail. This group was lead by a Skrull woman named Veranke, but her and her people were cast out for their prophecies. \[1\] One day, however, the force of nature known as Galactus showed up at the Skrull's homeworld and had a big yummy meal, which meant their primary world was as good as dead. Skrulls all began to realize that the prophecies of Veranke and her group were truth, and she was soon elected Queen of the Skrull Empire. As new leader of the Skrulls, Veranke set her sights on Secretly Invading the great blue planet Earth so her people could make it their new homeworld. Using data gathered from when a group called the Illuminati attempted to threaten them, the Skrulls began replacing Earthlings one by one, perfectly replicating both their memories as well as any superpowers they may have had while becoming completely undetectable by any type of science, magic, or seemingly anything. Some agents were even given the powers of multiple heroes to become Super-Skrulls, but we don't see much of these agents until a little later on. Veranke herself desired to get involved, wanting a role that would cause the most damage. The Earthling known as Jessica Drew, aka Spider-Woman, was selected due to her ties with both SHIELD and Hydra. \[2\] As Jessica, Veranke had a rare close relationship with the ultra-secretive Nick Fury, former Director of SHIELD and current wanted outlaw. Working for Nick, Veranke worked for both Hydra and SHIELD as a double-agent for both, but truly only answering to Fury.

\#2. Alien Avenger  
During a tour or something (not super explained) of the Raft, superhuman SHIELD Agent Jessica Drew is assigned to escort Luke Cage, Matt Murdock, and Foggy Nelson to the lower areas of the superhuman prison known as the Raft. Not long after these guests arrive, however, a complete blackout occurs, allowing all of the villains held here to break out. Heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Iron Man soon arrive to help our heroes, and soon the breakout is quelled. Several villains manage to escape, but the day is mostly saved. This event inspires Captain America to assemble a new team of Avengers, and he asks Jessica/Veranke to be one of the members. Already tied up with SHIELD and Hydra, as well as her own Skrull schemes, she checks in with the likes of Madame Hydra and Nick Fury before accepting. When both nerds want their own mole in the Avengers, Jessica agrees to join these New Avengers. \[3\] Here she ""reunites"" with an old friend, Jessica Jones, who is currently in a relationship with Luke Cage. Though she is now an Avenger, Veranke still has meetings in secret with her fellow Skrull agents. Anywho, Spider-Woman and the Avengers make it their mission to recover those villains who escaped from the Raft that night. They head to the Savage Land to recover Sauron, and while there they discover a splinter group of SHIELD agents stealing resources from the area. These rogue agents are locked away by the Avengers, aided by Wolverine who joins the team, and it's never discovered that these rogue agents were actually Skrulls in disguise.

\#3. Everything Goes Wrong  
Next, the New Avengers head to Japan to recapture Silver Samurai, who seems to be renewing his relationship with the villainous Madame Hydra. The Avengers arrive and defeat both villains, but let Silver Samurai go free when it's discovered the Raft had faked his death and were keeping him unlawfully. Still, the Avengers do get to go back with Madame Hydra in tow. Spider-Woman is still attempting to be heroic, but is forced to free Madame Hydra in order to keep her cover. \[4\] She almost gets away with it too, if it wasn't for that meddling Captain America, who catches a glimpse of what Jessica did. The next day, while at breakfast, Steve confronts her about this and why she freed Madame Hydra. Getting the OK from Fury, she informs Cap and the rest of the Avengers about her messy alliances with both SHIELD and Hydra, though chooses to keep her little green secret to herself. The Avengers find it harder to trust her now, but seem to understand and keep her on their team. Later, after a meeting between the Avengers and the X-Men, both teams head off to find the Scarlet Witch. Before they arrive, reality is reset into a world where mutants rule as a majority. Mutants are one of the biggest problems that the Skrulls faced as part of their infiltration, so this sudden change is devastating to invasion plans. Though most heroes don't seem to recall this change, the Skrull agents do. Veranke has a meeting with Skrull agent Criti-Noll, who is disguised as Yellowjacket, and the two discuss their options. \[5\] They agree to let this play out and pray that reality reverts to how it was, trusting the heroes of Earth to fix everything while planning to assassinate the Witch. The heroes manage to fix things without Wanda's death, and as the reality they knew returns, the Scarlet Witch who was responsible for this also greatly decreases the amount of mutants on Earth. This result is an immense step forward for the Skrulls' invasion plans, though the Annihilation Wave is a huge loss for their people.

\#4. Secret No More  
The Superhuman Civil War shatters the remainder of Earth's heroes, splitting the super community in half. Tony Stark and Maria Hill (current Director of SHIELD) attempt to trick Spider-Woman with a Life Model Decoy of Nick Fury, hoping to get her to reveal the location of Nick Fury. \[6\] Jess sees through this and escapes after a Hydra attack, joining up with the outlaw heroes and remaining with their Avengers team when the war comes to an end. Initially unsure of what to do next, the New Avengers soon decide to rescue their ally Maya Lopez, who they had left behind in Japan so she could continue monitoring criminal activities over there. They discover Maya had been captured by the Hand and brainwashed so she fought the Avengers alongside the Hand. The Avengers helped free her, and as revenge, Echo kills the Hand's leader Elektra. Elektra falls to the ground, revealing that she had been a Skrull imposter this whole time. Realizing the invasion has begun, the New Avengers can no longer trust one another, and Veranke is absolutely shaking in her boots, though remaining as collected as she needs to be to keep her cover. At first opportunity, she makes a run for it with the Skrull Elektra corpse, bringing it directly to Iron Man, the new Director of SHIELD after Maria Hill. \[7\] Now both the New Avengers and the Mighty Avengers are disrupted, which is only helped when Tony offers Jessica a place on his team. After a few weeks, Spider-Woman is confronted by Wolverine directly. By the end, he's somewhat convinced that she's not a Skrull, but dashes when her teammate Black Widow shows up. Not much comes from this encounter, but both Iron Man and Wolverine seem convinced she's human.

\#5. Out with the New, In with the Old  
When Stark hears reports of a Skrull ship landing in the Savage Land, he and his team head out there to investigate. Veranke makes sure the outlaw Avengers are also made aware, and both teams arrive on the scene. A slew of heroes pour out of the Skrull ship claiming to be the original versions. Before the confrontation, all of Stark's tech shuts off at once (thanks to the Hank Pym Skrull from before). Ms. Marvel hides Tony away in a cave to recover, so Veranke uses this moment to take advantage of Tony's moment of weakness. She attempts to trick him, convincing Stark that he has been a high-up Skrull leader all this time. \[8\] She fails to convince him however, and she's scared off by several Avengers who have discovered how to tell who is and isn't a Skrull. While these Skrulls had been keeping our heroes busy, an army of Super-Skrulls had begun invading New York, which is where Veranke heads next. The heroes arrive, turning the tides, and making the Skrull invaders desperate. After their last ditch effort plan is foiled, Veranke is taken down for good by Norman Osborn, which seems to end the invasion. \[9\] Iron Man locates the captives held by the Skrulls, and Jessica Drew is returned to Earth. Wolverine invites the real Jessica to take house with the outlaw Avengers, though there is some initial pushback. Wolvie reminds his teammates that Jess isn't the Skrull Queen any more, and their tone soon shifts as they can't judge her for the Skrull's actions. After Jess joins, she risks her life as part of a plot to lure the Dark Avengers out into a trap, but the trap turns on the Avengers when Osborn sends the Hood's men after her instead. The Avengers make it out of this ambush just barely thanks to a combo attack with Jess and Ms. Marvel. There was also a cool plot where she teamed up with Spider-Man, even briefly battling him when Mandrill took over her mind. But she broke free of his control with Spider-Man's help and kicked his butt, and that's really about all till the end of the volume. \[10\]

"Does X-Men ‚Äò97 Stand Alone? In Other Words, Can It Be Someone‚Äôs First X-Media?","I‚Äôve been thinking about this ever since last week‚Äôs phenomenal episode. X-Men ‚Äò97 has quickly become a GOAT comics show for me, along with the 90‚Äôs DCAU. But where those DC shows can stand on there own as an intro to those characters, even with no familiarity with the comics, I don‚Äôt think the same can be said of X-Men ‚Äò97 and that‚Äôs unfortunate, if unavoidable.

X97 is a direct continuation of a much lesser show that has 5 seasons of kiddie cornball tv production stories. A person who has never seen or read anything X-Men is probably not going to be moved to watch it, nor should they. But a familiarity with these characters in some form does seem to be a prerequisite for 97, if nothing else. Going into the show knowing the basic relationships, struggles, histories, etc.

This problem came to my mind as I was considering whether a friend would enjoy ‚Äò97. She doesn‚Äôt read comics or watch comic book movies and she was born in 98, so way after the 90s cartoons were relevant and even too young to be much aware of the early 00‚Äôs comic book movie boom. But, she has been getting into watching animation lately. She really loved both of the Spider-Verse films and she recently saw Paprika and loved that too. 

I think she would dig ‚Äò97 if she could follow it but I also think she would be totally lost. I know she won‚Äôt read the comics or watch the old show. I‚Äôm not even sure I could get her to sit through the original movies, or if I‚Äôd even want her too because they are all pretty dated and, IMO, inferior to 97. Don‚Äôt want to scare her off the idea!

What do you think about the idea that Mutants are essentially Eternals now?,"Basically what I mean by this is that in the past, mutants were portrayed as ‚Äúminorities‚Äù amongst humans. Obviously racial, civil rights allegory, everyone already knows about it no need to go into detail.

What they‚Äôve done recently is now mutants are now Demi gods. Like, as a whole. They don‚Äôt need to be accepted by humanity because they‚Äôre better in every way. They‚Äôre even better than other non-mutant heroes it seems like. Yeah there‚Äôs always been a hand full of mutants that could cause an extinction level event like Scarlett Witch(when they feel like calling her a mutant again), Mad Jim Jaspers, Franklin Richards(when they feel like calling him a mutant again), Legion, Phoenix etc‚Ä¶.

But recently it appears that the edict at Marvel is that mutants as a whole are to the level of Gods. Hell I‚Äôm pretty sure the X-Men could pull off a win against Asgard if they  needed to and it wouldn‚Äôt be controversial. ",Marvel,0,0.37
