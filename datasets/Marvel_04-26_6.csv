"[Amazing Spider-Man Family #1] ""Shadow of the Green Goblin"" made me check out some older JMD stories.","And man, what a legend good ol' J Marc Dematteis is.

To me, ""The Lost Hunt"" was a light in the darkness during the Wells run, and ""Shadow of the Green Goblin"" was even better. JMD's voice for Peter and everyone else was beyond impeccable. But one aspect that stood out to me, was Peter being confused about his Powers because he doesn't know their extent or how to control them yet, which leads him to wonder whether he was a hero or a monster. It felt like a very real look into a kid who suddenly got those powers.

Anyways, an editor's note sent me to ""Amazing Spider-Man Family"", and I discovered a few stories by JMD that really scratched my itch. This excerpt shows one of Peter's earliest heroics, and does a great job portraying the fear and confusion that a regular teenage boy, one not used to risking his life on a daily basis, would have to push through so early in his career as a Superhero. In all of those stories, JMD really touched on stuff that the Lee/Ditko run didn't, and his stories fit like a glove.
I'm
Personally, I've always loved all those stories set in the Lee/Ditko/Romita era like the brief Amazing Fantasy continuation, Untold Tales of Spider-Man, Spider-Man: Blue, Giant-Size Gwen Stacy and finally JMD's contributions. The new Ultimate Spider-Man is great so far, but It's nice to finally have another awesome story for good ol' Earth-616.",Marvel,7,0.9

"The ""Freaky"" episode with Spider-Man and Wolverine is still funny","I rewatched the Ultimate Spider-Man episode of Spidey and Wolverine switching bodies yesterday. Imo, it's one of the most rewatchable episodes of the show because of how hilariously stupid it is and that they kept the voice actors the same while acting like each other. Although Steve Blum is definitely better at sounding like Spidey in Wolverine's body while Drake Bell isn't good at imitating Wolverine in Spidey's body. If I were to ever make a pitch for a better show than what Ultimate Spider-Man was, I'm definitely keeping this concept since it's too funny to discard.",Marvel,1,0.6

Likable Reed Richards Moments?,"Hi, I constantly see examples of Mr. Fantastic being, at best, a inconsiderate smart moron for the greater good. But I, someone who isn't as familiar with the Fantastic Four, was wondering if anyone had any examples where Reed actually displayed anything about him that makes him charming or likable or whatever. I know about that time he went against AU versions of himself that took over their respective universes, but even at just the most mundane level, is there anything in the comics that made you go, ""yeah, I can see why Ben took a liking to this guy"" or ""okay, Sue, I get what you see in him.""

Change the World Challenge,"After thousands of issues, it’s easy to see how the Marvel world has been rocked completely by superpowered people and their shenanigans. But just how often does something ‘super’ happen? 

Read a random issue and say what events happened that would severely impact our world if they happened in real life. I’ll give some examples:

- Journey into Mystery (1952) #113
The Grey Gargoyle discovers a special formula that allows him to turn anything into stone. If this was real, construction would be so much easier/people would be cautious around statues forever.

- Resurrection of Magneto (2024) #4
A billion dollar platform gets destroyed. This might have been done without the public knowing (I’m not versed in modern comics yet), but this would have rippling effects on many areas of the economy.

- Children of the Vault (2023) #1
Okay this one’s just insane. Hundreds/thousands of ‘Tomorrow Towns’ are built around the world. Futuristic technology and medicine are introduced and there’s natural disasters up the wazoo.

It seems like every single Marvel comic has at least one event that would make breaking news if it happened today. What examples can you find?

Why did the Skrull Queen choose Spider-Woman?,"I just re-read the whole Secret Invasion event, and I don’t get why the Skrull Queen chose Spider-Woman as the most optimal person to take down the superheroes. Like Verkrane even said herself in some comic that she was the best choice.

Like there are a lot of other super types with way more influence then her, Carol Danvers, Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Steve Rogers, and Wanda Maximoff (before her breakdown) to name a few. Spider-Woman has never really had that wide range honestly.

Unless she chose Jessica to have a more subtle influence to play the heroes against one another, which even then she had plenty of other Skrulls who could take this position, while she had a more powerful one.

Could anyone explain this to me?

Avengers and Beyond Vol 4 - Norman Osborn,"Hello! Assuming you didn't see my first post (I ain't judging), I just read all of Avengers Volume 4, which includes New, Young, Dark, Mighty, and more teams. I also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. I'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain Avengers in the coming days, though I won't get to all of them. Also, I should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! Hopefully that adds something to the post. It might be a lot, but I hope you enjoy!

\#1. Green Goblin  
In the midst of the Superhuman Civil War, the Thunderbolts program was initiated to bring villains under government control, allowing them to essentially function as lawmen. Norman Osborn, aka the Green Goblin is specifically utilized as the Registration leader Iron Man's own personal hitman. The first target Tony sends the Goblin after is a reporter named Ben Urich, who had begun uncovering financial secrets about Stark, mainly that his company had been greatly profiting off this Civil War. In hopes to ward Ben off the case, Tony sends the Green Goblin to attack him. \[1\] None of these threats seemed to work, and Urich was able to quickly deduce that this was not the Goblin acting on his own. Despite this, I don't believe much ever came of Urich's stories unfortunately if they did get published. During the war, for reasons I cannot remember, a great number of sleeper Atlanteans began reawakening. I believe one group of these even caused an act of terrorism somewhere, but that may have been later during Dark Reign. When the Avenger Wonder Man discovers this group of Atlanteans amassing, Iron Man chooses to take drastic action. He the Green Goblin to privately take care of this Atlantean matter as thoroughly and not connected to SHIELD as possible. \[2\] The Goblin trashes the Atlanteans, and unfortunately Wonder Man as well who was caught up in everything. The Atlantean threat is ended, and the Green Goblin seemingly goes free.

\#2. Gaining Power  
After the Civil War, possibly for his successful work for Stark, Norman Osborn is given a promotion to lead the Thunderbolts he once was a member of. Here, Osborn works to reform villains into heroes supposedly (probably not). This time proves quite beneficial for Norman, seemingly giving him control over his own mind again. When most heroes where distracted in the Savage Land during the Secret Invasion, Norman and his Thunderbolts work to save New York from invasion alongside whichever heroes were left. The rest of the heroes did eventually show up, but the army didn't fully surrender until their Queen was assassinated by none other than Norman Osborn. \[3\] This put Osborn in great standings with the media and public, and he was soon set to replace Stark as the new Head of National Security, including SHIELD, Stark's technology, and, surprisingly, the Avengers. Now in charge of the protecting everyone, Osborn renames SHIELD to HAMMER (for no real reason) and begins making his own Dark version of the Avengers. He offers membership to the current Mighty Avengers, but the majority refuse to work for the former villain. The only exceptions are Ares and Sentry, the latter of which suffers from psychological issues which allows Norman to relate to him. \[4\] Despite being able to sympathize with the Sentry, Norman works throughout his Dark Reign to gain control of both the Sentry and his alternate persona, the Void.

\#3. Dark Avengers  
With his Avengers roster found lacking, Norman begins filling up the members with members of his former Thunderbolts team. However, many of these members are well known villains, like Bullseye and Venom, so he gives each of them the mantles of well known heroes as disguises. Norman even takes up a new heroic guise of his own thanks to having access to loads of Stark's old armors. Needing a symbol of hope for the team, he paints Captain America colors on a more recent model of armor, calling himself the Iron Patriot! \[5\] Although Norman's Avengers may now look like heroes, they're all still villains at heart (except for Ares and Sentry), and they begin to cause nothing but trouble for him. Hawkeye (Bullseye) kills a civilian in front of a News Helicopter, Spider-Man (Venom) has been eating body parts off of random villains, and of course Norman can't have these hooligans disrupting his perfect image. Fortunately for him, Osborn is a master of Public Relations manipulation, and somehow he manages to avoid bad press every single time. In hopes to secure his power and gain more allies, Osborn assembles some of the most powerful like-minded people in the community, such as Doctor Doom, Loki, the Hood, and more. \[6\] This alliance is full of mistrust and mostly doesn't work, but there are a few instances where they come to one another's aid. One such instance involves Iron Patriot travelling back in time with Doctor Doom, similar to how Iron Man had done earlier in the Mighty Avengers title.

\#4. Breaking Down  
This Cabal of villains ultimately proves more trouble than it's worth for Norman. Loki in particular takes several major actions against Osborn in order to cause mischief, all the while pretending to still be his ally. Loki forms another team of Mighty Avengers, led by Henry Pym, who claims his team is the real Avengers team as he is the only founding member leading. Pym and his team infuriate Loki to no end, and all the while Loki is posing as the Green Goblin inside Norman's mind in hopes of shattering his psyche once again. One of Norman's big failures comes during the event known as Utopia, where the mutants attempt to separate from humanity to form their own community. In attempts to thwart this, Norman creates his own team of Dark X-Men to combat these mutants, but his allies from the Cabal Namor and Emma Frost turn against him, resulting in the mutants getting what they wish for. Despite this loss, PR master Norman Osborn flips things around for the media and plays this off a win to be rid of the mutants. \[7\] Osborn takes another HUGE hit to his mental state when the Dark Avengers encounter the villain known as the Molecule Man. In their attempts to stop the villain, each member of the Dark Avengers are placed into a kind of psychic prison, which proves immensely devastating to psychologically damaged people like the Iron Patriot or the Sentry. \[8\] Norman's right-hand lady Victoria Hand manages to talk the Molecule Man into surrender, and the day is seemingly saved.

\#5. How the Mighty Fall  
The Avengers' battle against the Molecule Man, alongside the disbanding of the Cabal, is essentially the breaking point for Norman, a moment which is capitalized on by Loki. \[9\] The god of mischief convinces Osborn that Asgard's current relocation to Earth proves to be a threat to the common people, and Norman is convinced he should strike against the Asgardians. He attempts to get permission from the President, though he is turned down and warned. But ever the PR master manipulator, Norman triggers an event involving the Asgardian known as Volstagg that results in immense loss of civilian lives. Without permission from the President, the Iron Patriot uses this as an excuse to strike against Asgard, assembling every possible force at his disposal to join in the fight. Things begin to go badly once Captain America arrives with every Avenger available. Iron Patriot's helmet is knocked off, revealing Green Goblin paint underneath. \[10\] As a last ditch effort, Osborn commands the Sentry to crash Asgard down to Earth, which he does. Sentry actually goes full Void here, threatening the lives of everyone present, though this is ended after Thor slays him. In the chaos, Norman attempts to flee, but is caught by Captain America. Osborn and his allies are arrested, the rights to Stark's tech and the Avengers' name are restored, and Captain America becomes the new Head of National Security, summoning in a new Heroic Age for the world.

Episode 5 Fan Theory: Legion,"In episode 5 at 29:30 the wild sentinel says, “Omega level threat detected” 

Looking at the targeting reticle, it’s NOT centered on Magneto but on a tall haired lanky mutant who looks a LOT like Legion. Legion is an Omega level mutant who could propagate the psychic attacks we saw on our favorite telepaths, alter reality such that a wild sentinel just pops up in Genosha, AND be the key to undoing this horrible event. Cable time travel things could be a red herring.
