How Marvel can justify Magneto's holocaust survivor origin story in the near future?,"In a sad way, we are the last generation that can have interactions with people who experienced or survived the horrors of WW2. Even those who were babies back then are now old enough to die by old age and get buried by their great-grandchildren.

"If the MCU got a reboot, which Avengers storys/villains would you like to see them do?","Purely hypothetical.

Let's say the MCU got a reboot, they do something like a phase 1 again, ironman, cap, Hulk, maybe this time they add antman and Wasp into the original avengers bla bla bla.

If they didn't want to reuse the same villains, so no Loki, Ultron or Thanos.. what villains would you want to see for Avenger films?

I was thinking of this and found coming up with any really difficult. Because sure, you could do Galactus, Apocalypse or Zemo. But these villains, like many others, require a ton of set up first. Like you can't really do Zemo without having The Avengers already be a team. You can't really do Galactus without the Fantastic 4.

Anyway, who would you like to see? Or better yet, which stories would you like to see be adapted that the MCU still hasn't done?",Marvel,0,0.33

Spider-Man vs Batman,"All rounds are bloodlusted

No plot armor BS. Let’s be honest with ourselves

Round 1: Base to base. Spider-Man is in his regular everyday suit, no special armor or weapons. Batman has standard gear like his utility belt and other little stuff he carries around regular when fighting crime. They know nothing of each others abilities prior the fight

Round 2: They both get 1 month prep-time with full knowledge of each other’s abilities. They can bring whatever equipment necessary to incapacitate or kill the other opponent.

R1: What is there to really settle about this. Spider-Man will speed blitz and one shot Batman. Spider-Man is just so physically superior to Batman in every way. Batman has the advantage when it comes to BIQ and Combat Skill, but that stuff don’t matter when you are physically outclassed by 1000%. (I feel that Peter has as good as, if not higher IQ than Batman)

R1: Batman would most likely win based off what I’ve seen. However, let’s not downplay Peter. Even if you feel Batman is smarter than Peter, Peter is still one of the smartest characters in Marvel. We have seen time and time again that Peter is able to formulate multi-step plans to take down. Batman honestly only wins because of the “any equipment you want part”. If he pulls out the Hellbat suit, it’s most likely wraps for Peter. However, Peter is very smart and has been shown to make amazing technology by himself. For all we know, he could make something to counter the Hellbat. However, we haven’t really seen such a thing. So for right now, Batman stomps.

Lmk what yall think. If you have any disagreements, please feel free to let me know. However, provide something to back it up. Keep in mind, I’ve only read a little of their comics so excuse me if I get some stuff mixed up or incorrect.",Marvel,0,0.08

This movie (Hulk vs Wolverine) proved Deadpool can be very well done in a PG-13 setting ,"Lots of folks, due to the live-action films, seem to think Deadpool can’t possibly be done justice we’re he to be portrayed in a project that isn’t rated R. I think that’s just plain wrong. Deadpool in the comics isn’t as vulgar as his film adaptation and he’s still plenty funny. He also appears in other characters’ issues and isn’t as foul-mouthed or violent as he usually is, and he’s still very funny and a great addition. This animated movie helps prove that. The worst he says is “dammit” and Deadpool is still hilarious in this. He’s zany and just a complete goof amidst a very violent and otherwise serious setting. One could say the issue of gore would be an issue, as Deadpool is known for getting ripped apart in exceedingly gruesome ways for comedy’s sake, but you can still pull off things like dismemberment and beheadings in PG-13 just fine. It’s been shown many times before. 

Just wanted to share some thoughts on what I think is an overblown issue. ",Marvel,2439,0.94

"Any updates on nightcrawler origin, azazel and mystique??","I don't read the comics themselves (not enough income).  I catch spatterings here and there.

Avengers and Beyond Vol 4 - Ares,"Hello! Assuming you didn't see my first post (I ain't judging), I just read all of Avengers Volume 4, which includes New, Young, Dark, Mighty, and more teams. I also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. I'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain Avengers in the coming days, though I won't get to all of them. Also, I should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! Hopefully that adds something to the post. It might be a lot, but I hope you enjoy!

\#1. Thor Plus Wolverine  
After the Superhuman Civil War, Iron Man is placed in charge of National Security, including SHIELD. And together with Ms. Marvel, these heroes form a new team of Mighty Avengers by picking the best of the best from all available heroes. There were several roles they wanted filled, two of which being a ""Thor"" (god power) and a ""Wolverine"" (ready to kill if the need arose). Fortunately, Ms. Marvel knew just the person. The duo approaches Ares, the Olympian god of war and several time Avengers foe. \[1\] Despite their history, Ares accepts their offer, partially because he's impressed by Iron Man's insistence, but also so that he can provide a better life for his Earth-born son Alex. The Olympian immediately proves useful during a battle against giant Subterranean monsters, but particularly useful in the Mighty Avengers' battle against Ultron. The android takes over Tony Stark's biotech armor, reshaping his physical form to that of the Wasp (Ultron's ""mother""). Doctor Henry Pym is called in as an Ultron expert, and he develops a virus that should separate Ultron from Iron Man's biology. However, this virus needed to be specifically injected inside Ultron/Stark's body. Ares volunteers for the project, and he proves an excellent candidate thanks to his durability and battle skills as he fights against the robotic antibodies within. \[2\] Though they nearly overwhelm him, Ares is rescued by the Wasp, and the pair escapes before Ultron goes BOOM.

\#2. Son of War  
The goes on many more missions, battling against symbiotes and Doctor Doom. The team is approached by Jessica Jones and her child who needed help, and Ares adorably melted as soon as the baby arrived, presumably with memories of his own son. And speaking of Ares' son Alex, some time around now Nick Fury reaches out to Alex. Fury recruits the boy for his team of Secret Warriors, kind of a secret spy group loyal to Fury, and Ares is not made aware of this. Even during the Secret Invasion, Alex, Fury, and the Secret Warriors are out on the front lines battling while Ares and his team are off in the Savage Land dealing with their own thing. The Mighty Avengers do eventually return, but even up until the end Ares does not discover his son's actions with Fury. The Secret Invasion does finally end though when a man known as Norman Osborn assassinates the Queen of the Skrulls, and this man is celebrated as a war hero that even Ares admires the accomplishments of. Because of his heroism, the US government appoints Norman as the new Director of SHIELD (soon renamed HAMMER) and National Security. This role gives Osborn the rights to the Avengers name, and he extends membership to the current Mighty Avengers. Ares in one of the only two to join alongside Sentry as he admires Norman as stated earlier. \[3\]

\#3. Team Shade  
Despite his initial admiration, Ares slowly begins to see the seedier side of Osborn as time goes on and the Dark Avengers go on more missions. And while he's on the Dark Avengers, Ares finally discovers that his son Alex is working for Nick Fury. One day, ""on his way to school"", Alex is followed by Ares, who confronts Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors. \[4\] There is a brief battle, but Fury and Ares come to an understanding, and the god of war permits his son to work for Fury as long as Nick makes sure Alex is not harmed. So around now, Osborn sees an opportunity before himself. He happens to be in charge of HAMMER, the most prestigious group of combat trained agents in possibly the whole world, and he also has the Olympian god of war on his payroll. Norman gives Ares his own personal pick of all the HAMMER agents so that he can create the most effective team of elite agents possible. \[5\] Ares assembles a small band of men, and they are soon put to the test when Ares hears word from his mother Hera that his son has been injured and put in danger, which goes directly against his deal with Fury. The group breaks into the SHIELD base where they believe Alex is being held, but they soon realize they were mistaken upon their arrival. It is not Alex who was in peril, but another of Ares' sons named Kyknos, and he hopes to kill his father Ares to become the new god of war. A battle of immortal proportions ensues, which kills not only Kyknos, but also the men from Ares' elite squad. \[6\]

\#4. Gods and Monsters  
In the final days of this volume, Osborn begins planning a Siege on the immortal nation of Asgard, which has temporarily been displaced to Midgard/Earth. Osborn wants them gone and he needs the aid of his own personal immortal to make the battle successful. By his nature, Ares is greatly opposed to this plan, as the Asgardians are a highly honored people among the gods. He initially refuses to aid Osborn in his attack, even threatening to stop him if need be. \[7\] However, Norman is a master of manipulation, and through deception he ultimately convinces Ares to reluctantly lead his armies alongside him. Not too much time goes by before the strike against Asgard begins, and Ares fights with all his might as you would expect from the god of war. Things change when Ares is informed of Norman's deception. The god is enraged, and he immediately goes to attack Osborn for tricking him into committing such a despicable act. \[8\] Unfortunately for Ares, Osborn also has the Sentry on his side, and the Sentry has been manipulated into becoming his fully out of control Void self. Before Ares gets to Norman, Sentry/Void is instructed to protect him, and in this confrontation between Ares and Sentry, Ares is torn in half and perishes at his former ally's hand. (Google the image. It's epic, but I'm having trouble with the Auto-Mod already and don't want this post taken down.) Osborn and the Void are defeated, summoning a new Heroic Age, but at the cost of the life of an Avenger.

Question about Wolverine's immortality.,"So is Logan immortal or just has a real streak of longevity? 

Background to this so my friends were arguing that Wolverine can't be immortal because Hugh Jackman is getting older. And that because Jackman is getting older, it proves that eventually Logan will die. Of course, the basic problem with this, is that Hugh Jackman is a human being and not a comic book character. Whereas Logan from the comics is fictitious and can be young or old or whatever the writer wants. 

So within the main Universe, excluding Old Man Logan, excluding weird alternate futures, is Wolverine immortal? Could he theoretically live forever, or is there a set time limit baked into his character/ X-Gene such as his body will break down after say 2,000 years and it's inevitable?

I'm probably not going to be able to settle the argument with my friends since they can't get over the incontrovertible fact that Hugh Jackman aging has nothing to do with the character aging. But it will put my own mind at rest if I could just hear what folks think overall.",Marvel,1,0.57

Getting back into it after 15 years. Have questions.,"The last time I read comics was around the time of Spider-Man’s “One More Day” and X-men’s “Messiah Complex”

I don’t have too many questions about specific runs or characters, just about comics in general. I picked up the three issues of Ultimate Spider-Man, love them so far. I saw the ultimate universe got a soft reboot and it felt like the perfect time to jump in. Already watched a nice summary of the maker and what set up this new ultimate universe.  

Now for my questions. 

Should I read all the new ultimates if I want the complete story? If yes, how do I do this cost effectively? 

Are Black Panther and X-men the only other ones currently? Will more be added? (Hoping to see Father Murdock as Ultimate DD)

What’s the difference between 1st/2nd/3rd prints? Is it just the cover art? Are 1st prints more coveted?

Outside of the ultimates, any quick recommendations? Spider-Man and X-men were what I read most in the past, but am more open to other stuff now. Doesn’t have to be marvel but it doesn’t hurt.

Is what modern Spider- Man run is worth reading?,"I was wanting to read Nick Spencer’s run of SM but heard he messes up his story or it’s really bad etc. And just wondering if there’s a better recent, current, ongoing SM comic that I should read?

Vague memory of a Spider-Man comic,"I remember reading a Spider-Man comic during the mid 2000s (translated in Romanian). Spider-Man was fighting Electro at one point and Ulysses Klaw was also present there at one point. I also recall Silver Surfer appearing on a few pages. 

Does anyone have any idea what this comic might be? Thanks",Marvel,1,0.67
Which is scott summer's power origin?,"I remember that the basic information was he is passively absorbing ambient energy and that becomes optic blasts like his brother and his waves or beam. was there a retcon that made his eyes portals to another dimension or something? I remember hearing about that somewhere but with the show coming back, people still widely accept the ambient absorption. Also that kinda seems like a nerf, cause some further evolution could've been something a kin to bishop, but maybe more focused and constant. ",Marvel,0,0.33

"Question, Has Venom ever acted as a Wingman in a dating situation in the Comics?","So, I'm reading a fanfic (I know, I know) where Venom has bonded with Harry Potter (I Know).  This particular Venom is based off the Sony movies. Having not seen them, I still really enjoying the characterization.  Sort of a cross between a violently protective big brother and a proud parent (both mother and father).

Something that came to mind was if there had every been a point in the comics where Venom acted as a solid wingman for his host?

As a follow up, is there a point where Venom acts like described above towards his host?",Marvel,0,0.27
What are some story arcs you feel aren't talked about enough?,"There are many story arcs that receive either unanimous praise, or are otherwise constantly talked about: Infinity Gauntlet, Surtur Saga, Dark Phoenix, Civil War, Annihilation, Secret Wars, etc.

While these stories are certainly more than worthy of the discussion they've garnered, Marvel Comics is *long*. There are hundreds, even thousands of story arcs across its 80 years of history. 

What are some story arcs that you feel are underrated and should be talked about more?

&amp;#x200B;

My example would be Thor's ""War of the Pantheons"" arc from #383-400. While the first bit of this arc was rough, once it got started it was really exciting. The story is about Seth, the Egyptian God of Death, stealing the power of the whole Egyptian Pantheon and launching of invasion of Asgard after it was crippled in the war against Surtur. You see Balder as regent trying to hold everything together, Thor going on a good old fashioned quest, meet the Celtic pantheon, Seth feels like a genuinely menacing villain, and all together I think it's just one of Marvel's best ""war arcs.""",Marvel,12,0.79

I ask because I'm autistic and love Marvel so I wanted to see if Marvel had any autistic characters, and I found this list:
