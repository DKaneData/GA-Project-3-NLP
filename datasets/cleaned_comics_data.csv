- predaplant's pick of the week: [*detective comics* #1084] (https://m.media-amazon.com/images/i/81rmbjtzmul.jpg)

**for those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. for example, *wonder woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""wonder woman"" comment. clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too. in other words, you should only be replying to other comments. **do not post top-level comments**. 

**keep discussion civil.** do not harass other users for having a different opinion. do not use this thread to push your personal one-sided grudges against creators. reacting to a panel on twitter is not the same as reading a book.

74,"let's discuss ""the long halloween"" ending, who's actually the holiday killer?","note: lots of spoilers, don't read this post if you haven't read the comic

i just finished reading ""the long halloween"" for the second time, and i'm equally puzzled and intrigued by the ending as i was the first time. everything more or less makes sense until that strange and confusing conclusion. who is the holiday killer? how many holiday killers are there in total?

one of the theories, and probably the most plausible one, is that we have 2 holiday killers: the first one being gilda dent and the second one alberto falcone, who continues where gilda left off. there's no reason to doubt gilda's confession when she sets fire to holiday's remains while thinking out loud. so, i believe she actually did commit the murders up until new year's, wanting to free harvey from his job and protect the family. this would mean that gilda killed johnny viti, the irish gang, (although it's debatable how likely it is for one woman to kill a group of mobsters, but in comic logic, i guess it's possible), and milos, falcone's bodyguard.

alberto takes on the role of holiday after faking his death on new year's, but that part is somewhat unclear to me. it would take a lot of coincidences for alberto to pick up where gilda left off without any agreement or cooperation. but let's chalk up that inconsistency to comic logic as well. 

throughout the story, dent's role is the most unclear to me. he claims there are two holiday killers, which is probably the case, but we don't know if he's referring to himself as one of them (as batman assumes) or to alberto and his wife. does harvey even know that his wife is holiday? and if we were to include harvey's killings as part of the ""holiday killer"" murders, then would we have three holiday killers?

however, i believe harvey is not the holiday killer; his two murders are solely the result of personal vendettas that happened to coincide on holidays. gilda still believes harvey is the second killer, though, while in her logic, alberto is just a scapegoat taking responsibility for reasons known to him.

the story is quite complicated, and i honestly think the authors got a bit lost in the narrative, making it overly convoluted to the point of creating too many plot holes/leaps, and there isn't a perfectly logical explanation. so, all we're left with is to develop our own theories about what exactly happened and who the killers are. i choose the variant where the killers are gilda and alberto, while harvey only turns evil after becoming two-face, i.e., after the accident (although it could be argued that his malice started much earlier, given he knew about his wife's murders) ",DCcomics,48,0.83,let 's discuss the long halloween ending who 's actually the holiday killer,"note lots of spoilers do read this post if you have read the comic

105,real lazarus tournament?,"who would win if all the best martial artists were brought together? who would all be there?

here's my scenario( no killing goes to knock out. no powers)
my 8 (cause it makes even brackets) in no particular order are:
1. nightwing; i'm a fan boy so i put him first but he deserves to be on this list.
2. batman; if the guy above is on this list then yah
3. orphan; duh
4. lady shiva; at this point it is a mommy daughter father son play date
5. deathstroke
6. richard dragon
7. connor hawke
8. black canary
honorable mentions: bronze tiger, wildcat, karate kid

first round:
1vs8. dick wins. black canary is actually pretty easily beaten here. she is keeping up with the fight until dick gets her in a scenario where she would typically use her canary cry. she doesn't but it causes her to hesitate and dick wins

2v7. this one appears to everyone to be a fair fight until batman doesn't take a winning a blow and it becomes clear that he's seeing what connor can do. after bruce bears connor he offers him some advice and training if connor ever wants it. connor accepts on the condition he does not have to wear scaly green short shorts

3v6. idk much about richard dragon tbh but orphan is goated so she wins.

4v5. shiva beats deathstroke but deathstroke eggs her on into killing him. slade is resurrected by the lazarus pit and sent to the next round as shiva broke a rule

1v5. common i'm a nightwing fan boy you know this fight was going to happen. legitamently the most bloody fight of the tournament. dick changes his first name to mark because of how beat up he is after the fight (not actually its an invincible joke). dick falls many times but always gets back up. at the end slade asks why and dick says ""its the reason i fall"" and batman smirks. slade then forfeits.

2v3. at the start the fight is clearly being won by batman who seems to be getting very angry despite winning. half way through he stops and calls orphan out for not giving all she has. batman says she doesn't have to hold back out of fear of hurting him. orphan lowers her head and then becomes a different animal. this fight is really good with batman relying as much as possible on his strength and constitution, his inner monolgue stating that this strategy is a failing one as he taught her to fight opponents far stronger then him, but that he can't use gadgets or stealth or anything to win this fight. orphan beats him and afterward walks up to him and let's out a sigh and simply states ""how"" and batman tells her an elaborate way he could have won the fight. probably using the sand to blind her or something. orphan then states ""why"" and he says he wanted to fight her as a martial artist. as an equal.

3v1. i am conflicted on this one cause i know how i want to end it but i think it's my fan boy coming out again so i'll give two options.

1. orphan let's nightwing win because she understands his elevated role in the new dcu and what being the best martial artist in the world would do to help in that role.

2. nightwing tries to tire orphan out by acrobatically avoiding her, but even exhausted she still manages to win. he admits to being a little let down due to thinking it'd be a better fight. she puts a hand on his chest and says ""good"" and then puts it on her own and says ""better"" and smiles and they have a nice sibling moment to end the series.

debriefing with the batfamily later has damian absolutely livid he wasn't invited. babs and tim are talking about how martial arts won't mean much with the rate technology is improving. jason is absolutely roasting dick for losing to a girl after beating the worlds greatest assasin(or in scenario 1 hes roasting him because a girl had to let him win). steph immediatley implodes at jason for some unitended sexism. duke asks bruce for more martial arts training as he states he thinks out of everyone in the room he'd be the first to lose. he doesn't want to fall behind.

i have not read anything for the past 3 years so for all intents and purposes assume i know nothing. i am also on a student budget so i cannot read everything, nor do i have the time to do so. 

i have decided i would like to start at crisis on infinite earths (open to suggestions other than this) and would like to know either a few comics i should read to have the needed context or if anyone would like to write the needed context below that would be much appreciated. 

i want to understand the major events in dc continuity (when flash switches, when robin switches, the important events in general) and would like to do so in a condensed way. 

after reading crisis where should i go next? i have heard perez’s wonder woman is great, year 1 etc. 

i would like to read geoff jon’s green lantern and flashpoint at some point as well.

167,lower the stakes. (a message to dc comic writers and story writers in general),"the existence of superpowered heroes necessitates the existence of superpowered threats in order to produce real stakes. this is the danger in creating strong characters. a strong character needs a strong opponent. they beat said opponent, are proven stronger, and thus an even more powerful opponent is needed for any real threat to be present. this can lead to a lot of mindless power scaling that ultimately becomes meaningless- in the same way that hearing about one tragedy befalling a family often hits harder emotionally than seeing a statistic about hundreds of people being killed. our brains just can't really comprehend a scale like that. in my opinion, the constant ramping up of stakes cheapens the quality of storytelling. and in itself, the idea that every superhero needs to be ultra-powerful god-adjacent is unnecessary.

not every hero needs to be extremely powerful, because heroes are allowed to deal with different scales of threats on different levels. superman is incredibly strong, but he'll never be able to be everywhere, and he won't know how to solve every problem. heroes can exist that work on a smaller level. (like the friendly neighborhood spiderman, if he stayed neighborhood level.)

by having heroes that maybe aren't men of steel like kryptonians, you can have those more personal stories, but they don't *feel* like they don't matter or have low stakes. sometimes a story about trying to save a pet cat, or to save just one person, can hit a lot harder than one about protecting the globe, depending on the execution. you can still get really gritty and close-to-home with characters fighting for lower stakes. these stories also prop up the bigger ones, because they create anchors in the story for readers to latch onto: a tangible representation of the people these heroes are protecting, beyond just a statistic. it's hard to imagine the entire earth exploding, but knowing that the cat that a lower-level hero went through all that effort to save is going to go away? that's a lot more impactful than a number. 

further, i think that lower-level heroes are really empowering. because even though said character might not be superman, they're still helping people, no matter how small that effort is, which in itself is heroic. 

and weaker characters can be more than just a one-off mention to convey a message about community or something. you can place focus on lower-level threats, and still keep an audience engaged, as long as the story is compelling.

anyways, this is a plea for writers not to think they have to make every hero a master of their craft, and every villain world threatening. you're allowed to write weaker characters. it can highlight the strength of your powerful characters, and the strength of the relatively weaker ones in their own special ways. you to tell a lot of interesting, more grounded stories. there's a place for world-ending threats in comic book fiction. there's also a place for street-level threats.

185,the rumors of absolute dc,"its still very recent that the rumors started over this thing. frankly, i'm open to it; tbh, dc is a very rebooting company, so if you didn't expect this, to quote the james franco meme: first time, huh? however, this is not seen as a reboot at all, yet feels like it is, or separate.

to clear it up, this is what is know from bleeding cool: absolute dc aka dc all-in will be very close to the hands off/carte blance approach the old all star line was supposed to have, but to the larger dcu, led by scott snyder. so this is not like the new 52, or dc rebirth, but like ultimate marvel; but, it won't be separated from the main line, but published in conjunction instead, aiming for a spotlight on dc's entire lineup with this initiative. and above all, still in canon. if true, it would be an attempt to do new 52 right, and be a more ""holistic"" approach with dc rebirth. and of course, if it is true, we'll hear about it at sdcc 2024.

190,new crisis on infinite earths movies is better than the source material ,"part 1 and part 2 are out now. i’ll start by saying i think part 2 was pretty mediocre, but i thought part 1 was immaculate. more comparisons with the comic when i talk about part 2. 

lex and amazo

part 1 really impressed me. my favorite aspect was how threatening lex was made out to be. using parasite and amazo tech to make a super suit made it narratively satisfying when he used it to stand up to the entire justice league. too often is lex made out to be weak so this depiction of power really resonated with me. additionally, this is easily my favorite depiction of amazo. lex corrupting his programming to make him a villain made amazo and ivo a bit more more nuanced than a strong robot and evil scientist. i liked how ivo was the one who stopped him in the end by getting him to expel his energy.

clark and bruce

another thing i liked about part 1 was the justice league origin. i loved the dynamic between bruce and clark. bruce trusts clark to keep everything a secret, then gets his identity ousted by clark needing help. as a big batman fan, dragging bruce into a teamwork dynamic was very in character in my opinion. i also liked how the justice league wasn’t formed by some world threatening event. felt a bit more natural to have it happen due to clark being a bit clumsy with the secrets.

diana and barry

i always thought wonder woman was most tied to ww2 so i like that she is able to have that romance with steve trevor while also being apart of the modern world. i’m not the biggest multiverse guy but i enjoyed that being how wonder woman comes to the team. love her accent and built aesthic too. then this is probably my favorite depiction of the flash. keep in mind i only read batman. but he was funny and charismatic while not being a clown. his slightly goofy cool guy personality was very well done to me. 

here’s where i talk more part 2 and comics
personally i consider the crisis on infinite earths comic to be more history than a great standard of writing. the recruitment of all the heroes takes too many pages and the story looses momentum by focusing on too many realities that just aren’t that interesting. i like how part 2 seemingly relegates all the shadow demons to one film because they get much overstay their welcome in the comics. like i said earlier, part 2 isn't a good film but i think it depicts the whole tower defense arc of the comics better.

i also think the films are much better at fleshing out the characters of the monitor, harbinger, psycho pirate, and pariah. they feel like plot devices in the comic and less so characters with nuance. this is one of the biggest pros of the films since the plot essentially revolves around them.

also the crime syndicate was dope and i have no issue with lex's kid being removed. just made the comic more convoluted anyways

193,hot take on identity crisis and what happened to doctor light (spoilers for the comic below),"so we all know doctor light was made into a rapist and had to be lobotomized by the jla. 

my basic hot take/question is; 

am i seriously the only person who struggles to see how ""lobotomizing the guy"" is somehow worse than letting him go on to rape sue again. i mean come on what would you have done, would you have just sat by and let it happen. 

anyway i already know that this is the unpopular opinion on this subreddit and this post will be downvoted to oblivion but surely there is at least one person who agree it was the better option. a woman was raped and i'm 70% sure he not only was gonna do it again he also threatened to do it to the flash's wife after he found out who she was. 

the basic premise of the story is how the jla  betrayed batman but maybe because i'm not as crazy about batman as i was maybe 10 years ago but i find it so hypocritical how he has the nerve to talk about being betrayed when bro has a hit list on all his friends and is spying on them 24/7 with brother eye. i mean sit there and actually think about that. one of your friends having a hit list on you and all your fellow friends and everything you do he is just spying on you. 

the rest of the jla are always written to forgive batman no matter what he does and he is never in the wrong or the story will always bend over backwards to justify whatever he does (pretty sure identity crisis was written just to justify tower of babel) but when it's the other way around they have to seek his forgiveness and all admit how wrong they were. it really just makes batman unlikable for me and makes me wish he'd just stick to gotham.

&amp;#x200b;

anyway i sidetracked myself this post was about doctor light and my point is pretty straightforward. yeah if there was a better option then lobotomizing a man no matter how evil is pretty fucked up but there was no better option (except killing the guy) and so given the context of the situation i don't think the rest of the jla have anything to feel sorry for. it's like feeling sorry that you locked up a criminal because you are no better than a kidnapper...obviously you are. you are doing it for the greater good and the 2 scenarios are not the same. so yeah that's my post, i'll read all your comments if anyone bothers to respond",DCcomics,6,0.57,hot take on identity crisis and what happened to doctor light spoilers for the comic below,"so we all know doctor light was made into a rapist and had to be lobotomized by the jla

here’s my least favourite thing on new 52 wonder woman-the major disappointment of the new 52 version of wonder woman was clearly her cliché romance with clark. diana, who should embody strength and empowerment, was reduced to nothing more than clark's trophy. it's ridiculous and ludicrous that they thought a tired, cliché relationship would suit clark's character. worse yet, whenever they were together, diana was clearly portrayed as a flipping weakling and submissive. looks like the new 52 writers clearly dropped the flippin’ ball on understanding wonder woman's character.

198,part 2 to my post. ,"(sorry in advanced if i’m getting annoying with all these questions) 

i previously posted like 2 days ago. asking for a list of everything in new 52 &amp; how to read it. 

based on the comments, i wanna clarify/change some things. 

people said that reading everything isn’t recommended because apparently most of it is boring/bad. 

so ig i’ll just stick to dc characters i like. my top 5 ig would be (it’s wierd, ik) but batman, nightwing, the flash, green arrow, &amp; beast boy/teen titans. so ig my new questions are…  

1. since i’ve already started collecting a lot of new 52 tpb’s from those characters, so the completionist in me wants to finish those, &amp; i do plan on getting the rebirth runs of those characters. 

but is there a specific list of like everything batfamily related? cause the lists that i’ve seen are detailed, but are missing some runs. like i don’t see batman eternal or batman &amp; robin eternal. &amp; those are just the ones i know about. but what other runs am i missing that’s also missing on the lists yk? &amp; i’m also asking about other runs that include those characters or are universe events that affect everyone (like i think future’s end) 

2. what are some stories or runs that are good to read that focuses on those characters, sure i’d like the recommendations like hush, long halloween, etc. but doesn’t necessarily have to be the “popular” stuff. &amp; it doesn’t necessarily have to be one book stories. i don’t mind collecting runs that are like 6+ tpb’s. 

3. i’m confused on rebirth. ik that flashpoint basically reset dc into the new 52, but after fans not liking the new 52, they re-reset the continuity with rebirth. 

so my question is, is rebirth a continuation of whatever stories were being told before dc did flashpoint? or is it a full reset where i could start reading rebirth from the beginning without having to read older pre-flashpoint runs? &amp; also, what is rebirth’s version of flashpoint? like what storyline caused the reset in-universe. 

&amp; lastly. i’ve heard different explanations of rebirh. half say it’s a reboot of new 52, but it’s also a continuation, like to get the full full story, read both new 52 &amp; rebirth, like those characters still remember they’re new 52 versions, but went through changes for rebirth. but the other half say rebirth has nothing to do with new 52. it just kills off new 52 completely &amp; starts from scratch. which is it?

205,real lazarus tournament?,"who would win if all the best martial artists were brought together? who would all be there?

here's my scenario( no killing goes to knock out. no powers)
my 8 (cause it makes even brackets) in no particular order are:
1. nightwing; i'm a fan boy so i put him first but he deserves to be on this list.
2. batman; if the guy above is on this list then yah
3. orphan; duh
4. lady shiva; at this point it is a mommy daughter father son play date
5. deathstroke
6. richard dragon
7. connor hawke
8. black canary
honorable mentions: bronze tiger, wildcat, karate kid

first round:
1vs8. dick wins. black canary is actually pretty easily beaten here. she is keeping up with the fight until dick gets her in a scenario where she would typically use her canary cry. she doesn't but it causes her to hesitate and dick wins

2v7. this one appears to everyone to be a fair fight until batman doesn't take a winning a blow and it becomes clear that he's seeing what connor can do. after bruce bears connor he offers him some advice and training if connor ever wants it. connor accepts on the condition he does not have to wear scaly green short shorts

3v6. idk much about richard dragon tbh but orphan is goated so she wins.

4v5. shiva beats deathstroke but deathstroke eggs her on into killing him. slade is resurrected by the lazarus pit and sent to the next round as shiva broke a rule

1v5. common i'm a nightwing fan boy you know this fight was going to happen. legitamently the most bloody fight of the tournament. dick changes his first name to mark because of how beat up he is after the fight (not actually its an invincible joke). dick falls many times but always gets back up. at the end slade asks why and dick says ""its the reason i fall"" and batman smirks. slade then forfeits.

2v3. at the start the fight is clearly being won by batman who seems to be getting very angry despite winning. half way through he stops and calls orphan out for not giving all she has. batman says she doesn't have to hold back out of fear of hurting him. orphan lowers her head and then becomes a different animal. this fight is really good with batman relying as much as possible on his strength and constitution, his inner monolgue stating that this strategy is a failing one as he taught her to fight opponents far stronger then him, but that he can't use gadgets or stealth or anything to win this fight. orphan beats him and afterward walks up to him and let's out a sigh and simply states ""how"" and batman tells her an elaborate way he could have won the fight. probably using the sand to blind her or something. orphan then states ""why"" and he says he wanted to fight her as a martial artist. as an equal.

3v1. i am conflicted on this one cause i know how i want to end it but i think it's my fan boy coming out again so i'll give two options.

1. orphan let's nightwing win because she understands his elevated role in the new dcu and what being the best martial artist in the world would do to help in that role.

2. nightwing tries to tire orphan out by acrobatically avoiding her, but even exhausted she still manages to win. he admits to being a little let down due to thinking it'd be a better fight. she puts a hand on his chest and says ""good"" and then puts it on her own and says ""better"" and smiles and they have a nice sibling moment to end the series.

debriefing with the batfamily later has damian absolutely livid he wasn't invited. babs and tim are talking about how martial arts won't mean much with the rate technology is improving. jason is absolutely roasting dick for losing to a girl after beating the worlds greatest assasin(or in scenario 1 hes roasting him because a girl had to let him win). steph immediatley implodes at jason for some unitended sexism. duke asks bruce for more martial arts training as he states he thinks out of everyone in the room he'd be the first to lose. he doesn't want to fall behind. ",DCcomics,0,0.42,real lazarus tournament,"who would win if all the best martial artists were brought together who would all be there 

 here 's my scenario no killing goes to knock out no powers 
 my 8 cause it makes even brackets in no particular order are 
 1 nightwing i 'm a fan boy so i put him first but he deserves to be on this list 
 2 batman if the guy above is on this list then yah 
 3 orphan duh 
 4 lady shiva at this point it is a mommy daughter father son play date 
 5 deathstroke 
 6 richard dragon 
 7 connor hawke 
 8 black canary 
 honorable mentions bronze tiger wildcat karate kid 

 first round 
 1vs8 dick wins black canary is actually pretty easily beaten here she is keeping up with the fight until dick gets her in a scenario where she would typically use her canary cry she does but it causes her to hesitate and dick wins 

 2v7 this one appears to everyone to be a fair fight until batman does take a winning a blow and it becomes clear that he 's seeing what connor can do after bruce bears connor he offers him some advice and training if connor ever wants it connor accepts on the condition he does not have to wear scaly green short shorts 

 3v6 idk much about richard dragon tbh but orphan is goated so she wins 

 4v5 shiva beats deathstroke but deathstroke eggs her on into killing him slade is resurrected by the lazarus pit and sent to the next round as shiva broke a rule 

 1v5 common i 'm a nightwing fan boy you know this fight was going to happen legitamently the most bloody fight of the tournament dick changes his first name to mark because of how beat up he is after the fight not actually its an invincible joke dick falls many times but always gets back up at the end slade asks why and dick says its the reason i fall and batman smirks slade then forfeits

267,lower the stakes. (a message to dc comic writers and story writers in general),"the existence of superpowered heroes necessitates the existence of superpowered threats in order to produce real stakes. this is the danger in creating strong characters. a strong character needs a strong opponent. they beat said opponent, are proven stronger, and thus an even more powerful opponent is needed for any real threat to be present. this can lead to a lot of mindless power scaling that ultimately becomes meaningless- in the same way that hearing about one tragedy befalling a family often hits harder emotionally than seeing a statistic about hundreds of people being killed. our brains just can't really comprehend a scale like that. in my opinion, the constant ramping up of stakes cheapens the quality of storytelling. and in itself, the idea that every superhero needs to be ultra-powerful god-adjacent is unnecessary.

not every hero needs to be extremely powerful, because heroes are allowed to deal with different scales of threats on different levels. superman is incredibly strong, but he'll never be able to be everywhere, and he won't know how to solve every problem. heroes can exist that work on a smaller level. (like the friendly neighborhood spiderman, if he stayed neighborhood level.)

by having heroes that maybe aren't men of steel like kryptonians, you can have those more personal stories, but they don't *feel* like they don't matter or have low stakes. sometimes a story about trying to save a pet cat, or to save just one person, can hit a lot harder than one about protecting the globe, depending on the execution. you can still get really gritty and close-to-home with characters fighting for lower stakes. these stories also prop up the bigger ones, because they create anchors in the story for readers to latch onto: a tangible representation of the people these heroes are protecting, beyond just a statistic. it's hard to imagine the entire earth exploding, but knowing that the cat that a lower-level hero went through all that effort to save is going to go away? that's a lot more impactful than a number. 

further, i think that lower-level heroes are really empowering. because even though said character might not be superman, they're still helping people, no matter how small that effort is, which in itself is heroic. 

and weaker characters can be more than just a one-off mention to convey a message about community or something. you can place focus on lower-level threats, and still keep an audience engaged, as long as the story is compelling.

anyways, this is a plea for writers not to think they have to make every hero a master of their craft, and every villain world threatening. you're allowed to write weaker characters. it can highlight the strength of your powerful characters, and the strength of the relatively weaker ones in their own special ways. you to tell a lot of interesting, more grounded stories. there's a place for world-ending threats in comic book fiction. there's also a place for street-level threats.

290,new crisis on infinite earths movies is better than the source material ,"part 1 and part 2 are out now. i’ll start by saying i think part 2 was pretty mediocre, but i thought part 1 was immaculate. more comparisons with the comic when i talk about part 2. 

lex and amazo

part 1 really impressed me. my favorite aspect was how threatening lex was made out to be. using parasite and amazo tech to make a super suit made it narratively satisfying when he used it to stand up to the entire justice league. too often is lex made out to be weak so this depiction of power really resonated with me. additionally, this is easily my favorite depiction of amazo. lex corrupting his programming to make him a villain made amazo and ivo a bit more more nuanced than a strong robot and evil scientist. i liked how ivo was the one who stopped him in the end by getting him to expel his energy.

clark and bruce

another thing i liked about part 1 was the justice league origin. i loved the dynamic between bruce and clark. bruce trusts clark to keep everything a secret, then gets his identity ousted by clark needing help. as a big batman fan, dragging bruce into a teamwork dynamic was very in character in my opinion. i also liked how the justice league wasn’t formed by some world threatening event. felt a bit more natural to have it happen due to clark being a bit clumsy with the secrets.

diana and barry

i always thought wonder woman was most tied to ww2 so i like that she is able to have that romance with steve trevor while also being apart of the modern world. i’m not the biggest multiverse guy but i enjoyed that being how wonder woman comes to the team. love her accent and built aesthic too. then this is probably my favorite depiction of the flash. keep in mind i only read batman. but he was funny and charismatic while not being a clown. his slightly goofy cool guy personality was very well done to me. 

here’s where i talk more part 2 and comics
personally i consider the crisis on infinite earths comic to be more history than a great standard of writing. the recruitment of all the heroes takes too many pages and the story looses momentum by focusing on too many realities that just aren’t that interesting. i like how part 2 seemingly relegates all the shadow demons to one film because they get much overstay their welcome in the comics. like i said earlier, part 2 isn't a good film but i think it depicts the whole tower defense arc of the comics better.

i also think the films are much better at fleshing out the characters of the monitor, harbinger, psycho pirate, and pariah. they feel like plot devices in the comic and less so characters with nuance. this is one of the biggest pros of the films since the plot essentially revolves around them.

also the crime syndicate was dope and i have no issue with lex's kid being removed. just made the comic more convoluted anyways

293,hot take on identity crisis and what happened to doctor light (spoilers for the comic below),"so we all know doctor light was made into a rapist and had to be lobotomized by the jla. 

my basic hot take/question is; 

am i seriously the only person who struggles to see how ""lobotomizing the guy"" is somehow worse than letting him go on to rape sue again. i mean come on what would you have done, would you have just sat by and let it happen. 

anyway i already know that this is the unpopular opinion on this subreddit and this post will be downvoted to oblivion but surely there is at least one person who agree it was the better option. a woman was raped and i'm 70% sure he not only was gonna do it again he also threatened to do it to the flash's wife after he found out who she was. 

the basic premise of the story is how the jla  betrayed batman but maybe because i'm not as crazy about batman as i was maybe 10 years ago but i find it so hypocritical how he has the nerve to talk about being betrayed when bro has a hit list on all his friends and is spying on them 24/7 with brother eye. i mean sit there and actually think about that. one of your friends having a hit list on you and all your fellow friends and everything you do he is just spying on you. 

the rest of the jla are always written to forgive batman no matter what he does and he is never in the wrong or the story will always bend over backwards to justify whatever he does (pretty sure identity crisis was written just to justify tower of babel) but when it's the other way around they have to seek his forgiveness and all admit how wrong they were. it really just makes batman unlikable for me and makes me wish he'd just stick to gotham.

&amp;#x200b;

anyway i sidetracked myself this post was about doctor light and my point is pretty straightforward. yeah if there was a better option then lobotomizing a man no matter how evil is pretty fucked up but there was no better option (except killing the guy) and so given the context of the situation i don't think the rest of the jla have anything to feel sorry for. it's like feeling sorry that you locked up a criminal because you are no better than a kidnapper...obviously you are. you are doing it for the greater good and the 2 scenarios are not the same. so yeah that's my post, i'll read all your comments if anyone bothers to respond",DCcomics,4,0.55,hot take on identity crisis and what happened to doctor light spoilers for the comic below,"so we all know doctor light was made into a rapist and had to be lobotomized by the jla

here’s my least favourite thing on new 52 wonder woman-the major disappointment of the new 52 version of wonder woman was clearly her cliché romance with clark. diana, who should embody strength and empowerment, was reduced to nothing more than clark's trophy. it's ridiculous and ludicrous that they thought a tired, cliché relationship would suit clark's character. worse yet, whenever they were together, diana was clearly portrayed as a flipping weakling and submissive. looks like the new 52 writers clearly dropped the flippin’ ball on understanding wonder woman's character.

298,part 2 to my post. ,"(sorry in advanced if i’m getting annoying with all these questions) 

i previously posted like 2 days ago. asking for a list of everything in new 52 &amp; how to read it. 

based on the comments, i wanna clarify/change some things. 

people said that reading everything isn’t recommended because apparently most of it is boring/bad. 

so ig i’ll just stick to dc characters i like. my top 5 ig would be (it’s wierd, ik) but batman, nightwing, the flash, green arrow, &amp; beast boy/teen titans. so ig my new questions are…  

1. since i’ve already started collecting a lot of new 52 tpb’s from those characters, so the completionist in me wants to finish those, &amp; i do plan on getting the rebirth runs of those characters. 

but is there a specific list of like everything batfamily related? cause the lists that i’ve seen are detailed, but are missing some runs. like i don’t see batman eternal or batman &amp; robin eternal. &amp; those are just the ones i know about. but what other runs am i missing that’s also missing on the lists yk? &amp; i’m also asking about other runs that include those characters or are universe events that affect everyone (like i think future’s end) 

2. what are some stories or runs that are good to read that focuses on those characters, sure i’d like the recommendations like hush, long halloween, etc. but doesn’t necessarily have to be the “popular” stuff. &amp; it doesn’t necessarily have to be one book stories. i don’t mind collecting runs that are like 6+ tpb’s. 

3. i’m confused on rebirth. ik that flashpoint basically reset dc into the new 52, but after fans not liking the new 52, they re-reset the continuity with rebirth. 

so my question is, is rebirth a continuation of whatever stories were being told before dc did flashpoint? or is it a full reset where i could start reading rebirth from the beginning without having to read older pre-flashpoint runs? &amp; also, what is rebirth’s version of flashpoint? like what storyline caused the reset in-universe. 

&amp; lastly. i’ve heard different explanations of rebirh. half say it’s a reboot of new 52, but it’s also a continuation, like to get the full full story, read both new 52 &amp; rebirth, like those characters still remember they’re new 52 versions, but went through changes for rebirth. but the other half say rebirth has nothing to do with new 52. it just kills off new 52 completely &amp; starts from scratch. which is it? ",DCcomics,0,0.27,part 2 to my post,"sorry in advanced if i ’m getting annoying with all these questions 

 i previously posted like 2 days ago asking for a list of everything in new 52 amp how to read it 

 based on the comments i wanna clarify change some things 

 people said that reading everything is n’t recommended because apparently most of it is boring bad 

 so ig i ’ll just stick to dc characters i like my top 5 ig would be it ’s wierd ik but batman nightwing the flash green arrow amp beast boy teen titans so ig my new questions are  

 1 since i ’ve already started collecting a lot of new 52 tpb ’s from those characters so the completionist in me wants to finish those amp i do plan on getting the rebirth runs of those characters 

 but is there a specific list of like everything batfamily related cause the lists that i ’ve seen are detailed but are missing some runs like i do n’t see batman eternal or batman amp robin eternal amp those are just the ones i know about but what other runs am i missing that ’s also missing on the lists yk amp i ’m also asking about other runs that include those characters or are universe events that affect everyone like i think future ’s end 

 2 what are some stories or runs that are good to read that focuses on those characters sure i ’d like the recommendations like hush long halloween etc but does n’t necessarily have to be the popular stuff amp it does n’t necessarily have to be one book stories i do n’t mind collecting runs that are like 6 + tpb ’s

390,questions for a black canary cosplay for those who have done her before.,"hello everyone. first off, this will be my first cosplay for my first con so i am a complete and total newb so please have mercy. 

i am going to be doing a black canary cosplay and i already have some of the pieces (fishnets 😁, a blonde wig that should rock, and a pair of fine heeled boots). i am planning to find the rest online. i think i can find the choker easily enough. does anyone have any suggestions for the leotard/corset (i am leaning towards the latter or at least a leo that shows off some cleavage 😉) and the jacket (i'm looking for something a little thinner but maybe still leatherish if possible).

i'm looking to see if anyone knows where to look or if anyone who has cosplayed bc before would recommend something specific.

i'm looking to base my look on either/a combo of dinah in jlu and the mid and late 2000s justice league of america comics.

i'll post two of my ideas below.  


bioluminescence is the alternate version of black manta that is a sort of ""champion of two worlds"". david hyde was born as a child of two worlds, to two humans on the surface that quickly became enamored with atlantis. i see bioluminescence as a sort of freedom fighter against the reign of sea king, and filling the same ""hero of both worlds"". he's almost a comedically good person, having a strong code against killing, and pretty much dedicating his life to try and redeem sea king into a good king and leader for his people, while helping for small groups of atlanteans that live against his rule.  


the gull is the alternate version of the penguin that was a formerly wealthy. oswald cobblepot was a  bleeding heart millionaire that ran afoul with corrupt billionaire bruce wayne, who managed to cheat him out of most of hi, forcing him to go underground. he rose up as the gull- an underground psuedo mob boss that has become something of a hero for the city's underprivileged. he operates through informants of the city's lowest- vagrants and the homeless, those who owlman nor the corrupt gcpd pay much attention to, gathering information to hopefully drive his fascistic reign to an end.

anyway, i would totally give a mini or ongoing featuring “justice league earth” or whatever they’d call it a fair shot. are there any other characters you could see adding or swapping in?

402,should barry allen be older or younger?,"so i have been working on a big dc universe fancast for several years now at this point, but i started wondering this question recently. how old should barry allen be?

i should note i had set this fancast universe to have started in 2013, just to work with some actors at certain ages. i had dylan o'brien locked in for a while now, but recently other castings i started doing for nightwing and such have made me start wondering about other casting ideas. 

anyways the main point is that it got me thinking about what barry's accepted age range should be? either in his early to mid 20s, or around is early to mid 30s. because i think the two recent live action iterations have contributed to this confusion. grant gustin was 23 when he first started playing barry allen, and ezra miller was 22. as well, other barry's have been depicted as younger recently as well, like kill the justice league barry who says he is youngest member and acts like it.

but then there has been other depictions where he is shown as older. like john wesley shipp was 35 when he first played barry. as well several other versions from cartoons and games is shown as older at least, like young justice, the tomorrowverse, batman the brave and the bold and injustice.

so i've become a little confused about this then, especially since age in comics is weird. if you add wally into the mix when he becomes flash, then barry should be older, but then lately they show him as younger. 

i don't know. i was wondering if anyone had a answer to this? like do the comics point to him being a definitive age range among the league? or does it possibly not matter, he can be either based on your preference, considering all these different depictions.",DCcomics,1,0.54,should barry allen be older or younger,"so i have been working on a big dc universe fancast for several years now at this point but i started wondering this question recently how old should barry allen be

the projects are in the following order, in case anyone is curious:

1. superman: the man of tomorrow (film)
2. batman: the caped crusaders (film)
3. wonder woman and the justice society (film)

453,discussion about the crisis on two earths animated movie," spoilers maybe. the discussion is about an important quote from the movie.  


 tl;dr i think the peak-you-blinked-scene may be not that peak, since what i've learned about nietzsche's quote is that actually batman would be the one who blinked in this metaphor.

  
 when i first watched the movie i thought the use of nietzsche's catchphrase was very peak (he was known for using it when he went to fight crime and stuff). it's been used in a lot of superhero stuff, it's in watchmen, it's in like 40 batman stuff, it's in the beginning of the infinity gauntlet too if i'm not mistaken.

&amp;#x200b;

  batman tells that the difference between him and owlman is that both stared at the abyss, but owlman blinked. the original quote from beyond good &amp; evil and the sentence before is:  


 ""he who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a monster. and if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee. ""  


 i believe this means that if you stare into the abyss for long enough, get your hands too dirty, per say, you'll be inevitably changed by the things you're trying to deal with, maybe become a part of it. so... if batman is the guy who can deal with the horrors of gotham and doesn't become an cold blooded assassin and owlman is the one who was inevitably changed by all of this and became a nihilist who doesn't care about the importance of life, batman should be the one who blinked and owlman should be the one who stared into the abyss for too long.  


my question is, is friedrich nietzsche stupid? did he not read the infinity gauntlet?   


now seriously, do you have another interpretation of this scene that is more compatible? i'm seriously thinking the writers of the movie just didn't dive in the metaphor deep enough to see that the point was that batman doesn't gaze into the abyss long enought for it to gaze back at him.

459,i reworked my pitch for an r-rated green lantern film with kyle rayner (played by xolo maridueña),"plot:

on planet oa, parallax infects the entirety of the green lantern corp with his fear virus, causing them to fight each other and essentially cause a green lantern civil war. after the brutal fighting, the corp is wiped out. ganthet, the last surviving guardian of the universe, uses a boom tube to head to earth.

on earth, in star city, 25-year-old, kyle rayner, is a struggling artist, who works part-time as a janitor for an organization called cadmus. while walking home, kyle finds ganthet withering in an alleyway. ganthet uses his ring to scan kyle and determine that he's a worthy host. kyle is given the ring before ganthet dies in the alley.

over the next couple of days, kyle is learning how to use his ring. ganthet uploads his consciousness into the ring and acts as a mentor (like obi-wan kenobi). as kyle is training, he learns that cadmus discovered a meteor from deep space, which has unusual energy signals within it. cadmus's head scientist, hector hammond, opens the meteor and is infected with parallax's fear virus. hector is now under the command of parallax and infects all the cadmus employees with the fear virus. hector and the infected employees plan to use cadmus's dark matter energy core to create a wormhole that will directly link to oa so that parallax can release his fear virus on earth from oa.

kyle decides to accept his role as green lantern and goes to stop hector. there's a very violent battle at the cadmus facility, all the fear-infected individuals fight kyle with everything they can. however, hector creates the wormhole and parallax begins to release his fear virus. kyle uses his ring to block the wormhole but he knows he can't do it for long. after some encouragement from ganthet, kyle manages to close the wormhole and save earth. in the end, kyle becomes earth's protector.

throughout the film, we see a romance between kyle and alexandra dewitt, a photographer at the local paper. at the end of the film, they hook up.

anyway, that's the plot, a big improvement on my last draft. also, it'd still be an elseworld movie, with no justice league or big superhero teams, except for easter eggs and references to superman, alan scott, martian manhunter, and the jsa.

  
post credit scene:

kyle hovers over star city, but he's approached by an unknown figure who's also levitating. kyle turns around to see alan scott, dawned in his iconic red outfit and green cape, wearing a power ring. ""you're not the only lantern left,"" alan says.

in these images you can see that when caitlin isn't using her powers, she looks like a literal kid, a child, a brat,. but when she uses her powers, not only she gets harder, better, faster, stronger, etc, **she also transforms into a grown woman.**

**i went to the wiki for clarification on what was going on,** **to see if it was a billy batson situation,** but seeing the powers listed on the wiki not only did not explain what was going on, they also managed to leave me even more confused.

it mentions a **""transformation""** and a **""superhuman form""** but it explicitly states that **all this transformation does is it enhances her muscle mass, and as a result that enhances her physical attributes** (again... harder, better, faster, stronger, etc,). with all that out of the way my questions are:

**if what supposedly happens when caitlin transforms is she gets more buff with muscle mass, then why does she get taller, looks older and gain bigger boobs?**

is the clone ""**original form""** the **little girl?** or is it the **grown woman?**

...what is going on?

 my question is about the current version of the character the one in the dc comics universe that is also a clone apparently

479,superboy (1994 3rd series) review 0-100,"i just did a reread of one of my favorites as a kid. i entered the hobby at the death of superman and read knightfall, but the first series that i felt was mine, that i was excited to read each month of superboy by karl kesel and tom grummett.

you can essential divide the run into 4 parts. the first part 1-30 is (largely) karl kesel and tom grummett. it tells the story of superboy's establishing himself as he hero of hawaii, his relationship with tana moon, and a wonderful cast of characters (dubbilex, rex and roxie leach, knockout) culminating in the 6 part losin' it storyline where superboy nearly throws it all away. it's a great run marred only by the loss of grummett for most of the losin' it issues. it spans world's collide (milestone universe), the zero hour, and underworld unleashed events.

the second part is largely written by ron marz running from 31-49. i remember being a little disappointed that kesel and grummett had left the title, and actually stopped buying it at issue 41. it was years later that i picked up another chunk and rereading them now, it's not as bad. there are a few major elements that come out of this run, the climatic storyline being the five parter meltdown. there is an issue in the final night storyline too.

the third part is the (triumphal) return to the title by karl kesel and tom grummett, running from 50-79. i didn't return to the title because my teenage funds were limited and i was buying image at the time, but the lot i picked up had marz's and most of kesel's run. on first reading it didn't get me back to that level of excitement i had when i was a teen, but on this read through i really enjoyed it. lots of fun storytelling, new characters, a new situations. living at cadmus lent itself to encountering the new gods, and getting involved in the wider dc world. there's a couple of big storylines hyper-tension is a 6 parter, and then the climactic sins of youth crossover. there's also a day of judgement event tie-in.

the final part runs from 80-100, primarily written by joe kelly and then a team-up of palmiotti and didio. this was the part that prompted my rereading because when i first read it, i didn't have an appreciation of kelly at all. but after enjoying some of his other works, i began to suspect that maybe i was being too harsh on it. i wasn't a fan of the art and sometimes that can ruin the whole book. unfortunately, the book is as bad as i remember. it is aimless, full of lame humor, taking superboy away from his supporting cast that had been developed for 80 issues, from a dynamic story setting at cadmus to a dreary setting as the caretaker of an apartment complex. i'm not against big shifts, but it's hard to see this as anything more than a desperation to keep it going to achieve 100 issues. it's bad and a sad end to a mostly strong run.

down the road, i'll happily recommend the first 82 issues, but i advise you to drop it once kelly arrives.",DCcomics,8,0.76,superboy 1994 3rd series review 0 100,"i just did a reread of one of my favorites as a kid i entered the hobby at the death of superman and read knightfall but the first series that i felt was mine that i was excited to read each month of superboy by karl kesel and tom grummett

549,if i were to restart the dc cinematic universe ,"edit: a quick google search has shown me that james gunn is already doing a thing with this so this whole post is kind of moot.

preface: i am not commenting on any of the movies, i am not offering opinions on any of that or anything that might start controversy; this is merely the musings of a madman, albeit, a madman that wishes to remain polite and courteous to their fellow redditors. it’s also worth mentioning that i am not up to date on the last ten years of comics and the last 5 years of dc movies. 

i digress.

if i were going to restart the dc films, i would open up with a booster gold movie. 

why? 

he’s obscure enough that most casual fans don’t know who he is — and i think that works to everyone’s artistic benefit. less preconceived notions on the audience’s behalf going in. some people might not even know he’s from
dc, without the branding. 

he has an amazing redemption arc in the form of rip hunter’s lackey in keeping the timeline secure.  plus, his existence really makes it easy to lean into any of the 52/multiverse stuff if they wanted to. 

and, because his origin story leaves a pretty large opportunity to establish a cinematic franchise/the potential rosters of the jla. 

for those not hip to bg: he’s from the future and a washed up jock working at a museum, until he steals a bunch of old superhero tech from the museum, travels into the past to modern times to establish an overly commercial identity as a superhero. naturally, he does every bit of product placement you could imagine. the other heroes hate him for it — but that’s also why he was chosen to help keep the timelime secure… because nobody would suspect he would be trusted with such a responsibility. 

i dunno, i think it would be a really easy film to write and something that wouldn’t take itself too seriously. i’m sure someone else has pitched this before.

605,"to me, the best superman story of all time is kingdom come"," i remember first buying the hardcover edition which contained the whole series sometime in 1996 or 97 while i was on deployment in the navy. read it multiple times and it has stayed with me ever since.

and the reason why i think it's the best superman story is because it didn't take the low hanging fruit approach, which is making superman dark and edgy, or making him bewitched by red kryptonite or whatever.

instead, superman lost faith in society because society had lost faith in him. to me, this is profound. superman's powers have always come not from the yellow sun, but by the people's faith in him that he would always do the right thing. he was the ideal we aspired to, even if we knew we never really could.

that loss of faith lead superman to exile himself, and leave the world to its own fate. my reaction to that today is the same as it was back then: *holy crap!*

even back in the 90s, superman was seen as a dinosaur with outdated morals and principals. society wanted darker and grittier heroes who would kill bad guys on sight. they wanted more heroes like batman and the punisher (even though he's from marvel).

the entire story was about how superman and the classic members of the justice league - including batman! - gathered up all the new age superheroes and tried to show them what it meant to actually be a superhero. it was such an amazing story, and i don't really see writing like that today when it comes to supes.

i have no idea what the new superman movie will be about, but i sincerely hope at some point, someone tells a superman story similar to that. not just him saving the world from zod or darkseid, but grappling with an enemy more powerful than all of them: loss of hope.

do something like that, and you can kindly stfu and take all my money.",DCcomics,21,0.71,to me the best superman story of all time is kingdom come,"  i remember first buying the hardcover edition which contained the whole series sometime in 1996 or 97 while i was on deployment in the navy read it multiple times and it has stayed with me ever since 

 and the reason why i think it 's the best superman story is because it did take the low hanging fruit approach which is making superman dark and edgy or making him bewitched by red kryptonite or whatever 

 instead superman lost faith in society because society had lost faith in him to me this is profound superman 's powers have always come not from the yellow sun but by the people 's faith in him that he would always do the right thing he was the ideal we aspired to even if we knew we never really could

607,a plot idea for a mr. freeze solo movie,"inspired by some old posts i found on this sub-reddit and the less than optimistic response to my recent post on wb producing solo character driven movies for dc villains like mr. freeze, i decided to come up with a short plot of what a potential mr. freeze solo movie could be.

let me know what you're all think:

in the heart of gotham city, lived victor fries, a brilliant scientist whose life was forever altered by the warmth of love and the cold embrace of loss.

the movie begins with a glimpse into victor's past, a time when he was not yet known as the notorious mr. freeze. in those early days, he was a man of science, devoted to his research and driven by a relentless curiosity about the world around him. but amidst the sterile confines of his laboratory, there was a spark of humanity that set him apart – the love of his life, nora.

nora was unlike anyone victor had ever known – a beacon of light in his otherwise solitary existence. with her gentle smile and kind heart, she thawed the icy walls victor had built around himself, bringing warmth and joy into his life. their romance blossomed slowly, like a delicate flower unfurling its petals in the warmth of the sun.

as the movie unfolds, we witness the tender moments shared between victor and nora – picnics in the park, late-night stargazing sessions, and stolen kisses in the moonlight. their love is a force of nature, binding them together in a bond that transcends time and space.

but even the brightest flames are not immune to the chill of adversity, and tragedy soon strikes the young couple. nora falls gravely ill, her once vibrant spirit dimmed by the specter of a deadly disease. as her condition worsens, victor's world is plunged into darkness once more, his heart heavy with the weight of impending loss.

determined to save the woman he loves, victor throws himself into his work with renewed vigor, searching tirelessly for a cure to nora's illness. days turn into weeks, and weeks into months, but still, he refuses to give up hope. his laboratory becomes a sanctuary of sorts, a place where science and love intertwine in a desperate bid for salvation.

but fate is a cruel mistress, and despite victor's best efforts, nora's condition continues to deteriorate. as her life hangs in the balance, victor is faced with an impossible choice – to accept defeat or to defy the laws of nature itself. and so, with a heavy heart and a determined spirit, he embarks on a journey that will forever alter the course of his destiny.

the romantic part of the movie is not merely a subplot but the very heart and soul of the story, illuminating the depths of victor and nora's love and the lengths to which they will go to protect it. theirs is a love story for the ages, a tale of passion, sacrifice, and redemption that will linger in the hearts of audiences long after the credits roll.

if wb could greenlight films such as "" isn't it romantic"" , "" a hollywood christmas"" and "" locked down"", i see no reason why they can't give this a serious consideration.

injustice (read all 5 years i believe)

preacher (book one tpb in post)

   
 q1: i read roughly the first quarter of nearly everything dc rebirth, but never experienced any of the big reveals. do you think it's worth revisiting, if so is there a recommended order and set of tpb you can recommend?

q2: what is the current continuity?  is it linked to rebirth at all? is the current line of books well-perceived and worth looking into?

q3 my missy watched the sandman tv show without telling me or being aware it was comic adjacent and loved it. she has never read a comic in her life, and i have not read sandman in the past (i'm aware my current read of hellblazer is sandman universe) is there a current line of sandman tpb i can buy for her to enjoy? happy for stories told in the tv show or not.

q4: appreciate this is not an exact science, but further recommendations for other books/lines my partner might enjoy if she enjoyed sandman? (seems to like the concepts of the endless and biblical stuff)

q5: swamp thing have you read it and would you recommend it? would you start from the start or jump into a newer line (if it exists) tpb recommendations and general advice / pre-reading appreciated.

q6: what is considered a hot comic line currently, wither you agree with it or not?

overall, i'd say it was good, with a stretch of it (volume 4 and 5) being legit great. i think percy gets the essence of the character, which is always essential imo. there is nothing groundbreaking in his run but its generally solid. i preferred the art when it is handled by otto schmidt, but the other artists did a good job too. i'll always appreciate ""fighting the bigget man"" storylines, so it was nice seeing ollie's rebirth over the course of the run.

i'm looking to see if anyone knows where to look or if anyone who has cosplayed bc before would recommend something specific.

802,should barry allen be older or younger?,"so i have been working on a big dc universe fancast for several years now at this point, but i started wondering this question recently. how old should barry allen be?

i should note i had set this fancast universe to have started in 2013, just to work with some actors at certain ages. i had dylan o'brien locked in for a while now, but recently other castings i started doing for nightwing and such have made me start wondering about other casting ideas. 

anyways the main point is that it got me thinking about what barry's accepted age range should be? either in his early to mid 20s, or around is early to mid 30s. because i think the two recent live action iterations have contributed to this confusion. grant gustin was 23 when he first started playing barry allen, and ezra miller was 22. as well, other barry's have been depicted as younger recently as well, like kill the justice league barry who says he is youngest member and acts like it.

but then there has been other depictions where he is shown as older. like john wesley shipp was 35 when he first played barry. as well several other versions from cartoons and games is shown as older at least, like young justice, the tomorrowverse, batman the brave and the bold and injustice.

so i've become a little confused about this then, especially since age in comics is weird. if you add wally into the mix when he becomes flash, then barry should be older, but then lately they show him as younger. 

i don't know. i was wondering if anyone had a answer to this? like do the comics point to him being a definitive age range among the league? or does it possibly not matter, he can be either based on your preference, considering all these different depictions.",DCcomics,2,0.56,should barry allen be older or younger,"so i have been working on a big dc universe fancast for several years now at this point but i started wondering this question recently how old should barry allen be

the projects are in the following order, in case anyone is curious:

1. superman: the man of tomorrow (film)
2. batman: the caped crusaders (film)
3. wonder woman and the justice society (film)

my question is about the current version of the character, the one in the dc comics universe (that is also a clone apparently...)

in these images you can see that when caitlin isn't using her powers, she looks like a literal kid, a child, a brat,. but when she uses her powers, not only she gets harder, better, faster, stronger, etc, **she also transforms into a grown woman.**

**i went to the wiki for clarification on what was going on,** **to see if it was a billy batson situation,** but seeing the powers listed on the wiki not only did not explain what was going on, they also managed to leave me even more confused.

it mentions a **""transformation""** and a **""superhuman form""** but it explicitly states that **all this transformation does is it enhances her muscle mass, and as a result that enhances her physical attributes** (again... harder, better, faster, stronger, etc,). with all that out of the way my questions are:

**if what supposedly happens when caitlin transforms is she gets more buff with muscle mass, then why does she get taller, looks older and gain bigger boobs?**

is the clone ""**original form""** the **little girl?** or is it the **grown woman?**

...what is going on?

for superman, it was warworld; the epic saga that was the best superman story in years, and it help guide me to his current era with the relaunch and dawn of dc directive of superman and action comics. for batman, it was joker war that sets up the current status quo of the character; for wonder woman, it was trial of the amazons, and for the flash, the one minute war.

for green lantern, its...well, thats the point of this topic.

i asked recently about dark crisis, and everyone said to skip it. now part of the reason why i was curious about that event was its explanation toward earth being quarantine, and its connection to green lantern with the corps and oa, etc. but the fact that its skippable means to just go into gl's dawn of dc era with no issues, and after reading issue 1, i see alot has changed but easy to follow. 

still, is there something else to get instead?

looking at everything green lantern prior to dark crisis/dawn of dc, i think the answer might be grant morrison's the green lantern. i don't recall any negative reactions toward his run, and my research is suggesting no issues that would affect me either. 

question is: is his title the answer, or am i missing something? another title that i missed or perhaps didn't think was important, but is the answer.

 i asked recently about dark crisis and everyone said to skip it now part of the reason why i was curious about that event was its explanation toward earth being quarantine and its connection to green lantern with the corps and oa etc but the fact that its skippable means to just go into gl 's dawn of dc era with no issues and after reading issue 1 i see alot has changed but easy to follow 

 still is there something else to get instead 

 looking at everything green lantern prior to dark crisis dawn of dc i think the answer might be grant morrison 's the green lantern i do recall any negative reactions toward his run and my research is suggesting no issues that would affect me either 

 question is is his title the answer or am i missing something another title that i missed or perhaps did think was important but is the answer

1005,"to me, the best superman story of all time is kingdom come"," i remember first buying the hardcover edition which contained the whole series sometime in 1996 or 97 while i was on deployment in the navy. read it multiple times and it has stayed with me ever since.

and the reason why i think it's the best superman story is because it didn't take the low hanging fruit approach, which is making superman dark and edgy, or making him bewitched by red kryptonite or whatever.

instead, superman lost faith in society because society had lost faith in him. to me, this is profound. superman's powers have always come not from the yellow sun, but by the people's faith in him that he would always do the right thing. he was the ideal we aspired to, even if we knew we never really could.

that loss of faith lead superman to exile himself, and leave the world to its own fate. my reaction to that today is the same as it was back then: *holy crap!*

even back in the 90s, superman was seen as a dinosaur with outdated morals and principals. society wanted darker and grittier heroes who would kill bad guys on sight. they wanted more heroes like batman and the punisher (even though he's from marvel).

the entire story was about how superman and the classic members of the justice league - including batman! - gathered up all the new age superheroes and tried to show them what it meant to actually be a superhero. it was such an amazing story, and i don't really see writing like that today when it comes to supes.

i have no idea what the new superman movie will be about, but i sincerely hope at some point, someone tells a superman story similar to that. not just him saving the world from zod or darkseid, but grappling with an enemy more powerful than all of them: loss of hope.

do something like that, and you can kindly stfu and take all my money.",DCcomics,24,0.75,to me the best superman story of all time is kingdom come,"  i remember first buying the hardcover edition which contained the whole series sometime in 1996 or 97 while i was on deployment in the navy read it multiple times and it has stayed with me ever since

q2: what is the current continuity?  is it linked to rebirth at all? is the current line of books well-perceived and worth looking into?

q3 my missy watched the sandman tv show without telling me or being aware it was comic adjacent and loved it. she has never read a comic in her life, and i have not read sandman in the past (i'm aware my current read of hellblazer is sandman universe) is there a current line of sandman tpb i can buy for her to enjoy? happy for stories told in the tv show or not.

q4: appreciate this is not an exact science, but further recommendations for other books/lines my partner might enjoy if she enjoyed sandman? (seems to like the concepts of the endless and biblical stuff)

q5: swamp thing have you read it and would you recommend it? would you start from the start or jump into a newer line (if it exists) tpb recommendations and general advice / pre-reading appreciated.

q6: what is considered a hot comic line currently, wither you agree with it or not?

for detective comics i have these issues: 1080,1081,1082,1083, haven’t read them yet. but it seems like there is too much catching up to do in order to get into these? is there any point collecting issues after 1083 now or should i just resell them and wait until next arc, whenever it’s supposed to get started? 

for action comics i have the bizzaro story &amp; start of the house of brainiac that came out last week, so 1061,1062,1063,1064. same question here, but at least here it seems like 3-issue arcs which is good and easy to jump in?

lastly, i picked up the worlds finest 24,25 — same question, enough to jump in or would need more context/better wait? also, don't have any current batman issues, but same question. 

for context, also looking to start reading the current superman run — but for that i managed to get all issues 1-12, so hopefully there i have the full story.

i'm trying to remember a comic i read as a kid and need a little help identifying it. here are the details i remember:

* batman and wonder woman are involved in a subplot where they are trying to interrogate a criminal. 
* the criminal mentions something about a sailor's knot in relation to the crime they are investigating.

1262,[discussion] justice league: doom ruins the nuance of it's source material (spoiler for both the movie and comic),"warning: really long post

the 2012 animated movie justice league: doom is an adaptation of mark waid's miniseries jla: tower of babel, and the most iconic part of that story is the reveal that batman has a contingency plan for taking down the league if they were to ever go rouge, which has become a staple for online 'who would win' battleboard discussions. but despite the 2012 adaptation being an alright flick, the one thing it does wrong is the discussion on whether what batman did was right or wrong. i make this post because i just recently read the comic and  while it's not perfect, i felt the comic had a better more nuance take on the contingency plan than the movie.

in the comic book, every character has their own reason for deciding whether or not batman stays on the team. martian manhunter had his own files on earths superheroes in case he ever found himself needing to defend himself and 'defend' is the key word since he was all alone on the planet and had no idea who he can trust, offense was never something he intended, and even then he still regrets making those plans and being so distrustful. because of all that he decided batman should stay because even if he finds what batman did as bad, he feels he would be a hypocrite if he voted to kick him out. the flash (wally west in the comic) voted on batman staying because he felt that while he's furious at bruce, he's seen the incident where villains swapped bodies with members of the justice league, hell he's seen the reverse flash and the damage that he's capable of , after all the yellow prick killed his aunt, so he felt batman had a point in being prepared for the worst. the same went for green lantern (kyle rayner) he literally has the last ring in existence because hal jordan went crazy killed all the other lanterns and became a villain, yeah he didn't like batman for what he did, but he is 100% willing to see where he comes from he even understood not telling them. we never saw how superman voted but it's implied that he voted for batman to stay. superman totally gets it.

on the other hand you have aquaman who believes that they've all earned the trust of the world and at the very least should have trust for each other thus voting against batman. there's also plastic man who was still bitter about nearly being shattered into a million pieces and possibly dying which caused him to vote against batman even if batman was the only reason he was on the league but hey, that's what trauma can do to you. lastly was wonder woman who completely believed that batman didn't intend to abuse these plan nor let them get out, but she couldn't work on a team with someone that she and everyone else knows is actively analyzing all of their weaknesses to disable them even during casual conversation. knowing that his presence would weaken the league instead of strengthening them, she sadly voted him out. as for bruce? he left before the voting could even end knowing that him being on the team was going to be a hindrance and that he should have been more trusting of his team.

with all of that in mind, how did the film handle this part? by making every league member as one dimensional and as stupid as they could get away with. every single member with the exception of superman was simply too stupid to comprehend why these plans would and should exist and were mad at the existence of such plans, not the breach of trust. not only that but instead of batman waiting outside for his fate to be decided by the league before leaving shamefully as to not get in their way later down the line, now he was part of the conversation completely unrepentant and literally calls them all idiots, which in fairness they are but only because the film goes out of it's to make them all so, before leaving the league because apparently they weren't good enough for him.

it basically started the idea that the league is mad about the plans when that was quite literally never the issue and goes out of its way to paint any league member with powers as a short sided idiot for the sake of justifying the plans, loosing all the complex debate from the comics. there other issues i do have with both mediums like the flaws in the plans themselves and how batman was careless enough to have be stolen, twice, but for now i'll can just dismiss as comic book logic so the story could work.",DCcomics,52,0.82,discussion justice league doom ruins the nuance of it 's source material spoiler for both the movie and comic,"warning really long post 

 the 2012 animated movie justice league doom is an adaptation of mark waid 's miniseries jla tower of babel and the most iconic part of that story is the reveal that batman has a contingency plan for taking down the league if they were to ever go rouge which has become a staple for online who would win battleboard discussions but despite the 2012 adaptation being an alright flick the one thing it does wrong is the discussion on whether what batman did was right or wrong i make this post because i just recently read the comic and   while it 's not perfect i felt the comic had a better more nuance take on the contingency plan than the movie

1267,[discussion] anybody else tired of donna troy’s disastrous love life?,"art: by george perez

let’s get this out the way writers genuinely need to stop shipping her with characters until she gets some good stories and more character foundation outside of the titans. 

but anyways it’s a shame most of her stories revolve around her love life ( and getting erased from existence and getting her entire life retconned to an annoying degree) and how her relationships kinda just suck.

first we have terry long who of course is a marv wolfmans self insert (yuck) who is also her 30 something college professor that started dating her when she was a 18 year old freshman. (double yuck). now this would’ve been a lot less weird if they just didnt have him act like a total creep half the time. like referring to the titans as kids (same age as donna btw) while simultaneously flirting with all the girls in the team. and of course they got married had a kid together and divorced because terry started to feel insecure and started blaming all of his life’s problems on donna being a hero. now the whole being a divorced mom juggling being a superhero would’ve been an interesting for donna if terry and their kid didn’t get fucking annihilated.

then we got roy and there relationship is very…eh…in my opinion i know it gets a lot of praise because of donna being a mother figure to lian and them having a lot of history from dating and being on the same team when they were teenagers. but honestly i think most of the praise is just from him not being terry. my main problem with roy and donna’s relationship is how they never had a moment that didn’t involve baby mamma drama, divorce,dead/crazy ex lovers or donna being brought from the dead and having an extensional crisis. 

like there was barely any genuine moments where their shitty lives weren’t constantly brought up and at best they were just fuck buddies. first because of donna’s divorce and then they were kinda sorting dating/fuck buddies again when she was brought back from the dead but this time roy was catching feelings but donna thought he was a total fucking loser (she told him this to his face btw) and wanted to see if she had free will via dating him because she was brought back from wally’s memories of her being perfect. and when she broke things off she didn’t really give a shit about roy’s feelings she was only afraid of lian becoming too attached to her.

another problem is just roy just constantly being a man whore like there were some old titans silver age panels were teenage roy would hit on chicks in front of donna during their dates and one panel where it was implied they broke up because he hit on her roommate. which i wouldn’t put past him in those days. and then the whole fuck buddies arc thing where roy was constantly fucking anything with a pulse (tried to fuck a mermaid while his daughter was there btw) and donna was just kinda having a dry spell i guess.

 i think it would’ve cute if roy had an arc were he decides to stop being a player and tries to go steady with donna. with him feeling out of his element because for once he isn’t just focused on getting laid. they could’ve had cute dates where they go to chuck e. cheese with lian or something along those lines but instead we just got them shooting a bow together…which was ok i guess…",DCcomics,39,0.76,discussion anybody else tired of donna troy ’s disastrous love life,"art by george perez

these films offer a fresh perspective, allowing viewers to empathize with characters traditionally portrayed as antagonists. moreover, it opens up storytelling opportunities for unique narratives and anti-hero arcs. following the mcu fatigue, people are looking for depth and nuance in the movies they choose to support

the success of villain-centric movies(as proven by the reception to the joker movies) have the potential to diversify the studio's revenue streams, reducing dependence on traditional hero-centric narratives. additionally, merchandise sales, streaming rights, and potential spin-offs could further boost profits, creating a lucrative new avenue for revenue generation for dc. dceu might have lost the war for the heroes, but we could definitely win it for the villains.

addendum: we've had blockbuster trilogies from less known comic characters like guardians of the galaxy, venom and ant-man. so being lesser known is obviously no longer a good reason for wb to fail once again at capitalising on these great opportunities.

**before creation**

- before creation, it was said that there was only a great darkness; a single black infinitude where nothing and everything were the same thing. from the darkness came a burning light. as the light grew, everything was no longer nothing and the darkness screamed, causing an imperceptible flaw in what was once the immaculate perfection of the light. with the birth of the source from the dark, forces danced with each other like threads on destiny's loom, giving birth to the lords of chaos and the lords of order.

- the source of all things created the hands to populate the void with multiverses using anti-crisis energy. after creating their multiverse, each hand would return their energies to the source. however, one rogue, named perpetua, refused her fate and desired a vicious reality of eternal crisis and rebirth.

- god (aka yhwh/“the presence”/ the voice/ the hand/ the source) creates a companion for himself. after a dispute, that companion is cast down to the realm that will later be hell, becoming known as “the first of the fallen.” god replaces him by creating the angelic host.

**dawn of time (20 billion bce)**

- some time before perpetua created the first multiverse, the great darkness spawned a ""daughter"" in the void and entrusted her to ""the shadows"" of a subsection of the void called the dark garden.

- the source, from which sprung forth an explosion of incalculable energies that heralded the dawn of time. manipulating this newborn multiverse was perpetua, who entrusted its three realms of matter, anti-matter and dark matter to her sons. as the cosmos slowly expanded and gave rise to stars and planets.

- destiny, first of the endless is born and recorded all that transpired in his book.

- hecate born inside other plane which will become sphere of gods

**18 billion years ago**

- the original godworld forms also known as asgard or urgrund. (inside plane which will become sphere of gods)

**17 billion years ago**

- other life appears on the godworld (the “second world”).

- death and dream of the endless born

**15 billion years ago**

- perpetua called upon mar novu to show him her greatest creation. perpetua had searched the endless worlds of the multiverse looking for the perfect creation, but could not find it. disappointed in what saw, perpetua bound the martians with the humans, creating the apex predators; perfect killing machines that would live and fight until the end of time. upon seeing what his mother had created, mar novu told her that he found a cosmic judgement coming for them because of her actions and that she was well aware of that and wished to fight back. perpetua then tried to share her point of view in vain, leading her to order her apexes to attack novu, forcing him to flee.

- humanoid lifeforms on urgrund attained godhood, thus becoming the old gods. first among the old gods was olgrun.

**13.8** **billion years ago**

- mar novu told his brothers what he had seen and they agreed that her kinds, the hands needed to be alerted of her doings. they were interrupted by perpetua who witnessed their betrayals and sent her apex predators to attack her sons.

- the hands's response was to send the cosmic raptor to stop perpetua's plan. unable to defeat the cosmic raptor, perpetua, her apex predators and the totality of her power were taken to the source wall and imprisoned in it. the hands recreated perpetua's multiverse, allowing the multiverse to evolve without intrusion. perpetua was trapped and forced to watch it all.

- imperiex-prime is created to repeatedly destroyed the universe to create a new one from the ashes of the old.

- after the recreation of the multiverse, the story of perpetua was hidden by krona and the other maltusians who gathered all evidence.

- a race of beings called aurakles emerge from the source at the beginning of creation. in time the race spawns one individual who is fascinated by the lives of organic beings. a sentimental aurakle witness the death of violet harper and unwittingly reaches out to her. it is then forever trapped in her body.

- rallying a third of the angels to his side, lucifer the morningstar began a war in heaven against his brother, the archangel michael, who defeated lucifer's forces and cast them down into hell, where they were reborn as demons. one of the fallen angels begged forgiveness and was transformed by michael into the wrath of god, the instrument of divine vengeance. another angel, who refused to fight for either side, was cast out by heaven and hell, condemned to walk earth alone for the rest of eternity, a stranger to all.

- destruction of the endless is born; his sword is created. delight, last of the endless, follows after him.

- on cilia, the lords of order manifest themselves as the first sentient race in the universe, a race of energy beings. presumably, the lords of chaos follow suit.

**10 billion years ago**

- humanoid life appears on planet maltus. maltusian myth tells of a triarch born then: tzodar the destroyer, quarra the cultivator, &amp; archor the grower. they turn on their father, the great god daalon, then abandon maltus, scattering to far corners of universe, one day returning to level maltus &amp; any who live on it. (the triarch did not really exist at this time.) legends of triarch will inspire a controller to create his own triarch millions of years later

- a non-organic race called the kregors create functioning brains from biological material. they use the brains as power sources.

- volthoom discovered the maltusian species on the planet maltus. these maltusians were an incredibly intelligent species who sought to learn the secrets of the spectrum. the maltusians planned to pour all of their emotions into a new battery they called the great heart, as they believed losing their emotions would lead to greater discoveries. upon successfully completing the ritual, a power ring emerged from the center of the great heart. volthoom slipped this ring on and became the first lantern in the multiverse.

- krona, a maltusan, built a machine to discover the secrets of the very creation of the universe. he watched through his portal a gigantic palm with a broth of stars in his hand as the machine exploded.

- driven by guilt over krona's actions the maltusans created manhunters which they then replaced with the green lantern corps. however, due to differences on how to deal with the evil created by krona the maltusans split into the guardians of the universe and controllers.

- he spectrum began to affect the mental health of volthoom, ultimately leading to his insanity and an attempt to kill the maltusians.

- in order to secure their inventions, the maltusians destroyed his travel lantern, thus trapping volthoom in the prime earth universe. after killing thousands of maltusians as a form of revenge, volthoom was defeated by the seven ""proto-green lanterns"", the great heart ripped from his chest, and the first power ring taken away. soon after, the guardians imprisoned volthoom in an unbreakable chamber (known as the chamber of shadows), and wrote him out of their history. a number of maltusians (now named 'guardians') remained behind to ensure that the first lantern was kept imprisoned and became known as the hidden ones.

- olgrun fell to madness and murdered his own daughter in his rage. the other old gods warred against him for an age and eventually defeated him, but were unable to kill him. they split his essence into seven ""aspects"" which they scattered across the multiverse

- without olgrun, urgrund fell into war. at the heart of this conflict was lokee, god of mischief and bastard son of the chief god wotan, who became the first god of evil. the conflict between the forces of good and evil escalated until ragnarok came that saw godworld being torn asunder in a great explosion where the gods perished.

- one of the weapons used in the titanic conflict of the old gods, mageddon the anti-sun, is imprisoned in a gravity sink on the outer curve of spacetime.

**5 billion years ago**

- apokolips &amp; new genesis form inside the plane later know as sphere of the gods. 700,000,000 after that life begins on apokolips and new genesis.

- the earth coalesces from cosmic dust.

- the demons abnegezar, rath, and ghast reign over the earth, until banished by the timeless ones.

- vanishing point is created by the linear men, located in limbo — at the heart of the source.

**3 billion years ago**

- after defeating the demons of the empire of tears on the planet ysmault, the guardians of the universe attempt to banish sorcery from the cosmos by gathering together the universe's magical energies into a single mass called the starheart.

- massacre of sector 666

- king kull was the ruler of a race of protohumans known as the submen, a race which ruled the homo sapiens until eventually overthrown in a revolt. as a result, kull locked himself in a state of suspended animation.

- the oan race splits along gender lines. the females become known as the zamarons and leave oa. they temporarily settle on the planet korugar as its rulers.

**1 billion years ago**

- the dark dreams of a cosmic entity give rise to a new dimension called darkworld. certain godlike beings were created along with it: chief among these beings were weaver, guardian &amp; master of multi-colored threads of magical energy; chaon, twisted god of evil &amp; chaos; gemimn, goddess of order; tynan, cosmic balancer of order &amp; chaos; deedra, goddess of nature; and jheryl, goddess of truth &amp; knowledge.

- a race of shaggy blue-furred humanoids on the planet rann banish the evil scientist and would-be tyrant carlon zan into space. a time-warp transports zan to the present day and transforms him into a radioactive menace.

- the xan, a race of humans from another planet, establish a super-civilization on earth, living in celestial cities built by advanced science. as a specialized builder of robots and androids, his greatest achievement is eternal, a giant half-robot, half-android built to live forever, energized by cosmic radiation, and given the full knowledge of the xan in his artificial brain. incredibly wise and powerful, eternal planned to conquer earth for himself. before he could do so, a cloud of space gas hit earth, gas the xan knew could kill them. eternal traveled to the earth's core to find absorbium, the only element that could counter space gas, but the absorbium caused eternal to be paralyzed for one billion years.",DCcomics,0,0.33,timeline,"i 'm making timeline for my fanfiction right now any suggest for what comic i need to read and web i need to read here my current timeline right now very very incomplete this one is created using dcwiki superheroes fandom wiki cosmicteams 's timeline dcuniverseonline fandom wiki and dcu.smartmemes(web archive

1333,additional robin ,"my kind of sad idea, regarding nightwing and red hood. we all know that first kid of bruce was dick, he was very young and all. once he was enrolled into the private school after bruce adopted him, he was kind of bullied but didn't told it either to bruce or alfred, because he was still recovering from loss of his parents, but there was one kid who was always protecting him from bullies in school. later dick came to the information that his saviour from the bullies was also an orphan (kid of teenage couple who decided to let go of him), but since he was very talented in science he did revived a scholarship to the prestige school (the one that dick was in). and since he was few years older than him he was kind of big brother figure for dick. it didn't took long for dick to invite his brother figure (let's name him michael)to the mansion, since he was only one who was nice to him. it didn't took alfred more than a second to see what was dick planning, which is convincing bruce to adopt michael. i took some time but with combined dicks and alfred convincing him, he did it. michael was teenager at the time he was adopted by bruce and was in heaven, first because someone did adopted him at least, second he really did liked dick, and last well living in wayne mansion can't be that bad for a teenager. of course after sometime he did figured out about batman and robin. one night when batman and robin where on a patrol he just figured out the combination on the piano and walk right into the batcave. of course bruce wasn't very happy with that, but decided to give him a chance. bruce did few simulations on michael and he was shocked how good he was. it didn't took much time until michael could go with batman on the patrols. of course there was an issue with two robins at one time but they quickly figured it out by giving michael his own superhero name the knight, michael choose it by himself, of course lucius created new suit for him. micheal was more that happy to help batman, and since he was his own superhero he did tried to go by himself, failed few times but was successful most of it. there were of course ups and downs in the story, but michael never did turned his back on dick, always was big brother to him. when came the time came when dick changed from robin to nightwing, everyone understud dicks motives. not long after nightwing moved to bludhaven, the knight was working on the huge case of human trafficking, he did asked bruce if he can go on his own to the south america to end it, bruce wasn't against it, he was even happy that michael wanted to do something by himself and he did trusted him to bring the organisation to the justice. after few months of being in south america michael returned to gotham successful. then he noticed that there is yet another robin. he wasn't happy with that idea because he knew exactly what is the price of it, and he did told it to bruce, there was a huge fight between them about it, but then michael saw jason, and he turned from anger to compassion. michael and jason really quickly liked eachother, michael did a lot of training with jason, and he did appreciate it, it came to the point where bruce let michael take jason on patrol by themselves. michael was really great big brother figure for jason but he didn't forget about dick. there were time that only three of them went for a patrol, alfred of course had to convince bruce for the whole day to allow that, but there were ""only brothers patrols"". of course we know how it goes with jason. in this he's killed at the time when dick and michael fight the crime ring in bludhaven together, of course they hear the news form gotham that robin was killed by the joker. micheal was so angry at that that he took off and went straight for the joker, he did had joker on his knees laughing, michael wanted and almost took the last swing at joker but was stopped by batman, micheal and bruce looked into eachother eyes and bruce knew he lost one more son today. their relationship was never the same, michael almost never visited wayne mansion, and when he did was only speaking with alfred. of course after sometime there was a red hood incident in gotham. not long after they did figured out that red hood is resurrected jason, and when there was a fight between red hood and joker, michael did interviewed, kicking red hood aside but leaving himself vulnerable to joker, michael took off his mask, looked at jason, said ""i'm sorry kid"", and smiled very warmly before joker shoot him in the head. 
after that bruce did had enough of jokers, and everyone did assumed he was going to kill him, but now it was jason who stopped him, telling him that michael wouldn't want that.
the justice league don't know about michael (the knight) because bruce doesn't like to talk about that. jason did became darker and more distance from everyone. and dick, he like always hide his pain behind humour.

vandal savage, and ra’s al ghul may have immense levels of wealth from being alive for so long. both probably either similar or greater to lex and bruce.

1422,"let's discuss ""the long halloween"" ending, who's actually the holiday killer?","note: lots of spoilers, don't read this post if you haven't read the comic

i just finished reading ""the long halloween"" for the second time, and i'm equally puzzled and intrigued by the ending as i was the first time. everything more or less makes sense until that strange and confusing conclusion. who is the holiday killer? how many holiday killers are there in total?

one of the theories, and probably the most plausible one, is that we have 2 holiday killers: the first one being gilda dent and the second one alberto falcone, who continues where gilda left off. there's no reason to doubt gilda's confession when she sets fire to holiday's remains while thinking out loud. so, i believe she actually did commit the murders up until new year's, wanting to free harvey from his job and protect the family. this would mean that gilda killed johnny viti, the irish gang, (although it's debatable how likely it is for one woman to kill a group of mobsters, but in comic logic, i guess it's possible), and milos, falcone's bodyguard.

alberto takes on the role of holiday after faking his death on new year's, but that part is somewhat unclear to me. it would take a lot of coincidences for alberto to pick up where gilda left off without any agreement or cooperation. but let's chalk up that inconsistency to comic logic as well. 

throughout the story, dent's role is the most unclear to me. he claims there are two holiday killers, which is probably the case, but we don't know if he's referring to himself as one of them (as batman assumes) or to alberto and his wife. does harvey even know that his wife is holiday? and if we were to include harvey's killings as part of the ""holiday killer"" murders, then would we have three holiday killers?

however, i believe harvey is not the holiday killer; his two murders are solely the result of personal vendettas that happened to coincide on holidays. gilda still believes harvey is the second killer, though, while in her logic, alberto is just a scapegoat taking responsibility for reasons known to him.

the story is quite complicated, and i honestly think the authors got a bit lost in the narrative, making it overly convoluted to the point of creating too many plot holes/leaps, and there isn't a perfectly logical explanation. so, all we're left with is to develop our own theories about what exactly happened and who the killers are. i choose the variant where the killers are gilda and alberto, while harvey only turns evil after becoming two-face, i.e., after the accident (although it could be argued that his malice started much earlier, given he knew about his wife's murders) ",DCcomics,47,0.82,let 's discuss the long halloween ending who 's actually the holiday killer,"note lots of spoilers do read this post if you have read the comic

 one of the theories and probably the most plausible one is that we have 2 holiday killers the first one being gilda dent and the second one alberto falcone who continues where gilda left off there 's no reason to doubt gilda 's confession when she sets fire to holiday 's remains while thinking out loud so i believe she actually did commit the murders up until new year 's wanting to free harvey from his job and protect the family this would mean that gilda killed johnny viti the irish gang although it 's debatable how likely it is for one woman to kill a group of mobsters but in comic logic i guess it 's possible and milos falcone 's bodyguard 

 alberto takes on the role of holiday after faking his death on new year 's but that part is somewhat unclear to me it would take a lot of coincidences for alberto to pick up where gilda left off without any agreement or cooperation but let 's chalk up that inconsistency to comic logic as well 

 throughout the story dent 's role is the most unclear to me he claims there are two holiday killers which is probably the case but we do know if he 's referring to himself as one of them as batman assumes or to alberto and his wife does harvey even know that his wife is holiday and if we were to include harvey 's killings as part of the holiday killer murders then would we have three holiday killers 

 however i believe harvey is not the holiday killer his two murders are solely the result of personal vendettas that happened to coincide on holidays gilda still believes harvey is the second killer though while in her logic alberto is just a scapegoat taking responsibility for reasons known to him 

 the story is quite complicated and i honestly think the authors got a bit lost in the narrative making it overly convoluted to the point of creating too many plot holes leaps and there is a perfectly logical explanation so all we 're left with is to develop our own theories about what exactly happened and who the killers are i choose the variant where the killers are gilda and alberto while harvey only turns evil after becoming two face i.e. after the accident although it could be argued that his malice started much earlier given he knew about his wife 's murders",77,2640.0,11,456.0,1

i would be. i think each individual issue being twice as big can help with some of the pacing issues some modern comics have. and producing it on cheaper paper would help keep the cost of each issue reasonable. 

plus, with comics being priced at two dollars an issue, that's 10 comics for just $20. you can't tell me that's not a good deal.

(original post)

i have been trying to read the comics on marvel unlimited since getting the subscription last week, but somehow every day it gets harder to find any comics when i search for them. this includes comics i started reading the day before and wanted to finish.

i have been trying to search for excalibur 1988 #1, to finish reading it, but it’s gone.  i can find the current series 2019, which gives me individual issues for pages instead of just showing me a list of issues; but then the search starts giving me wolverine issues. worse, it floods the search with articles, videos, etc, instead of just giving me the comics.

i got this subscription so i can catch up on the comics from the start, the whole story, and follow along with various x-men podcasts like a good little nerd; but instead of being a normal database of comics - like a library, if you will - it’s as if it’s designed by someone who hates having to share the information.

if people are paying for a service you’re offering, access to your content, once we’re in you need to let us read the content. it’s fine, you already have the money, and if you want more you need to let the content work its magic. it’s digital content, so reading it won’t leave grubby finger marks on the digital pages.

marvel: please make it easier to find the issues so i can read them. whatever is going on in your current design is just making me resentful and want to quit. “rage quit” is not going to lead to me buying anything later. i want to be so invested in the content i end up buying replica magneto helmets and nightcrawler socks and other stuff, but i can’t get there if the bad website design stays this bad and i give up in frustration instead of engaging in commerce with your business.",Marvel,9,0.67,is marvel unlimited disorganized on purpose,"edit   a huge thank you to everyone who helped me with the baby steps to figuring this out   i was playing with the browser and typed the comics series and it took me to a simple alphabetical list of series which then had the issues albeit with the first issues at the very end the site can use instructions for people like me who do n’t have people who can teach them in real life there ’s lots out there and comics are for everyone

for example, is he someone a human character can actually talk to? not talk to an avatar but the entire being of the one above all. does he have emotions and a personality? 

or is it more conceptual? 

conceptual as in like all characters are the one above all because the one above all is everything and everywhere. so that means the timelines, the clothes that people wear, the concept of brushing teeth, the being of eternity, and everything and every thought in the multiverse and beyond are all apart of the one above all’s “body”. in this scenario doctor strange cannot defeat the one above all because if strange shot a fireball at him, technically that fireball is the one above all and so is doctor strange and the air he breathes, so it would basically do nothing. in this case, he is angry, happy, sad, vengeful, enlightened, depressed, hungry, and full all at the same time and yet he isn’t feeling anything as well, he is literally (by the definition of literally) nothing and everything at once.

i am talking about villains who don't make sense as characters. i am not talking about a character with a simple motivation, if your actions fit your motive, it's fine. bullseye likes to kill people and get paid for it, he could make money legitimately elsewhere, but his love of violence prevents him from doing so, and that's fine.

so i am going to pick on two fantastic four villains, trapster and wizard. trapster's motive is supposed to be greed, but why didn't he just patent his glue and market it, he could have made millions legitimately, but didn't, for no good reason. trapster has nearly died several times, gets punched out by superheroes constantly, and has been subjected to ghost rider's penance stare and he is still a supervillain, why? the writers also can't decide whether he is a real serious supervillain or a comic relief character, pick one lane and go with it. either have trapster quit, up his game by a lot, and pick on a street-level character instead of a team that fights gods for a living or have him be a purely comic relief character. there is a prose novel short story from the 90s where trapster tries to reform, that is more interesting character work than anything that has been done with him in the comics, but it's not canon.

&amp;#x200b;

wizard is worse on this score, he has even less reason to be a public supervillain, if he wasn't a public supervillain with a record he would be a dangerous force in the business world. instead, he is a third-rate supervillain. he is jealous of the ff's fame and reed richard's abilities, but did he think becoming a public supervillain would make him more beloved than the ff? he is supposed to be smart, but he makes the same stupid mistakes over and over again, he always tries to defeat the ff with a frightful four instead of trying to overwhelm them with a frightful fourteen, he and the frightful do not seem remotely in the fantastic four's league. he's too evil to be sympathetic and not evil enough to actually be sinister or menacing. he is similar to the type of villains kid shows have been parodying for the last 20 years.

1970,my thoughts on phoenix saga,"**let me preface this by saying that this is the first time i have ever read an x-men comic of any kind. my experience with the x-men is solely due to the various animated shows and movies. after years of watching the mcu i decided to read marvel comics. i decided to start with x-men because i felt like the animated offerings were good to great but the movies, most of the time, were bad. i wanted to see what they were actually like.**

**now this doesn’t mean i am oblivious to x-men. i am proud to be a pretty nerdy guy so over the last 33 years of my life i have stumbled on comic art, comic book covers, and what i would consider light spoilers over that time.**

**after doing some research i decided to start from the very beginning for two reasons. 1) i thought it would be interesting to see how these characters change and evolve over time. 2) the original x-men comic was canceled which meant i didn’t have to read 200+ issues to hit uncanny x-men. i only had to make my way through 66.**

**previously i did review, or at least, my thoughts on the original x-men run.**

[https://new.reddit.com/r/marvel/comments/1buud2a/my\_thoughts\_on\_silver\_age\_xmen\_maybe\_light/] (https://new.reddit.com/r/marvel/comments/1buud2a/my_thoughts_on_silver_age_xmen_maybe_light/)

**if you are not interested in reading that, to sum it up, i overall liked it. way more than most people like the silver age x-men. i originally was going to do my thoughts on uncanny x-men omnibus vol 1 but i decided to forego that and instead do my thoughts on the phoenix saga which i am counting as staring on issue #101 and going up to #138**

**so without further ado let's get to it.**

issue 101: i have seen the cover of this issue before. the phoenix bursting out of the water. i know the loose cliff notes version of the phoenix saga in comics. this was my first time actually reading the story though and i will have to say the first couple pages are what i expected. jean grey crashed into the ocean before bursting forth from it. what i didn’t expect was afterwards her ending up in a hospital bed as cyclops stays by her side, the others go on a vacation.

honestly that was my biggest surprise about the phoenix saga how long it lasted. i could only imagine what it must have been like picking it up as they came out. overall a great start to the phoenix saga.

issue #105-#108: i have no idea if this is a hot take but after reading this arc and thinking back to the silver age i have realized something. i do not like when the x-men deal with aliens or go into space. i don’t even know what to say about this arc really. the alien civil war did nothing for me and finding out cyclop’s dad was corsair was a neat idea but i am about twelve issues into the uncanny omnibus vol 2 now and nothing has come of this yet. the ending was cool was the phoenix but other from that… eh.

**so the rest i will kind of shoot off the top of my head as the rest of what happens with phoenix is kind of scattered and peppered throughout.**

jason wyngarde was a very intriguing and interesting villain as is the idea of the black queen. the only question i have is… did he really not know she was phoenix? why did he just want jean grey? when the phoenix kills him i believe it is cyclops that says that jason had no idea phoenix was a thing but i swear jason was also the one that said that he had accounted for her getting mad and upset after he attacked cyclops. it was cool to see mastermind again though.

cyclops went from my least favorite x-men to one of my favorites. same with wolverine. in the beginning of chris clarmont’s run i couldn’t help but wonder why wolverine was so darn popular. by the time the volume 1 omnibus concluded i understood it. i would also like to do a re-read one day where i track when wolverine went from being an unruly asshole to giving off more loveable drunken uncle vibes.

storm is easily my new favorite x-men. enough said.

ok. enough mucking around let's talk about the actual event. i understand why the phoenix saga is so beloved now. a true epic. do i believe that there are better stories that have taken place in the comic medium since? yes. for the time though i understand why this was such a big deal and why people hold it in such high regard. the last five issues or so when the x-men walked into the hellfire club to cyclops recounting his time as an x-men and walking off is easily one the best stories i have had the pleasure to read. that is to say nothing of everything else.

i think the only thing i was slightly confused on is what phoenix was exactly? me reading issue after issue may have fuzzed some details. however, i can’t help but ask… it came from the solar flare, correct? it was obviously some cosmic entity and not like the movies portray where it is a part of her? if anyone can give me some insight into this that would be nice.

all in all i would give it 8.5.",Marvel,0,0.17,my thoughts on phoenix saga,"let me preface this by saying that this is the first time i have ever read an x men comic of any kind my experience with the x men is solely due to the various animated shows and movies after years of watching the mcu i decided to read marvel comics i decided to start with x men because i felt like the animated offerings were good to great but the movies most of the time were bad i wanted to see what they were actually like 

 now this does n’t mean i am oblivious to x men i am proud to be a pretty nerdy guy so over the last 33 years of my life i have stumbled on comic art comic book covers and what i would consider light spoilers over that time 

 after doing some research i decided to start from the very beginning for two reasons 1 i thought it would be interesting to see how these characters change and evolve over time 2 the original x men comic was canceled which meant i did n’t have to read 200 + issues to hit uncanny x men i only had to make my way through 66 

 previously i did review or at least my thoughts on the original x men run 

 

 if you are not interested in reading that to sum it up i overall liked it way more than most people like the silver age x men i originally was going to do my thoughts on uncanny x men omnibus vol 1 but i decided to forego that and instead do my thoughts on the phoenix saga which i am counting as staring on issue 101 and going up to 138 

 so without further ado let 's get to it 

 issue 101 i have seen the cover of this issue before the phoenix bursting out of the water i know the loose cliff notes version of the phoenix saga in comics this was my first time actually reading the story though and i will have to say the first couple pages are what i expected jean grey crashed into the ocean before bursting forth from it what i did n’t expect was afterwards her ending up in a hospital bed as cyclops stays by her side the others go on a vacation 

 honestly that was my biggest surprise about the phoenix saga how long it lasted i could only imagine what it must have been like picking it up as they came out overall a great start to the phoenix saga 

 issue 105-#108 i have no idea if this is a hot take but after reading this arc and thinking back to the silver age i have realized something i do not like when the x men deal with aliens or go into space i do n’t even know what to say about this arc really the alien civil war did nothing for me and finding out cyclop ’s dad was corsair was a neat idea but i am about twelve issues into the uncanny omnibus vol 2 now and nothing has come of this yet the ending was cool was the phoenix but other from that eh 

 so the rest i will kind of shoot off the top of my head as the rest of what happens with phoenix is kind of scattered and peppered throughout 

 jason wyngarde was a very intriguing and interesting villain as is the idea of the black queen the only question i have is did he really not know she was phoenix why did he just want jean grey when the phoenix kills him i believe it is cyclops that says that jason had no idea phoenix was a thing but i swear jason was also the one that said that he had accounted for her getting mad and upset after he attacked cyclops it was cool to see mastermind again though 

 cyclops went from my least favorite x men to one of my favorites same with wolverine in the beginning of chris clarmont ’s run i could n’t help but wonder why wolverine was so darn popular by the time the volume 1 omnibus concluded i understood it i would also like to do a re read one day where i track when wolverine went from being an unruly asshole to giving off more loveable drunken uncle vibes 

 storm is easily my new favorite x men enough said 

 ok enough mucking around let 's talk about the actual event i understand why the phoenix saga is so beloved now a true epic do i believe that there are better stories that have taken place in the comic medium since yes for the time though i understand why this was such a big deal and why people hold it in such high regard the last five issues or so when the x men walked into the hellfire club to cyclops recounting his time as an x men and walking off is easily one the best stories i have had the pleasure to read that is to say nothing of everything else 

 i think the only thing i was slightly confused on is what phoenix was exactly me reading issue after issue may have fuzzed some details however i ca n’t help but ask it came from the solar flare correct it was obviously some cosmic entity and not like the movies portray where it is a part of her if anyone can give me some insight into this that would be nice

you guys feel free to correct me if i'm wrong but, with everything that's happened so far and what's yet to be resolved, we have the following: 

tombstone's plan for spidey

peter's relationship status (particularly with m)

norman osborn's sins

new sinister six plot 

chasm/hallow's eve plot 

&amp;#x200b;

i think that's all the major story beats that wells needs to resolve before ending his run. considering that tombstone was teased in web of spider-man, and the chasm stuff seems like it's getting resolved in the next issue maybe, all that's left is this sinister six polot and how norman's sins are going to play into it. my guess for what's going to happen is as follows: 

norman's sins fully manifest in norman, prompting the return of the green goblin. exploiting the now hot potato nature of his sins, green goblin uses them to re-corrupt peter. giving birth to this spider-goblin. when peter was possessed last time, he went on a hitlist of all that wronged him in his life. so, given this time he seems fully transformed by the sins, spider-goblin goes on a rampage. targeting the sinister six and everything that's wronged him in his life, including the green goblin (which, based on asm 54's cover, seems like the two goblins are gonna duke it out and the end). mj, paul, randy and the other supporting characters will probably play a big role across these 5 issues. all the while, tombstone will continue amassing resources for his plan to take out spider-man once and for. with issues 55 through 60 being tombstone's plot and the final arc of the wells run. ending with hopefully a final resolution on peter and mjs relationship and a final showdown between spider-man and tombstone. 

what do you guys think? am i missing anything? in a weird way, i'm kind of excited to see where this spider-goblin storyline goes considering how long it is (an 80 page issue with four following issues). though it's still so weird that peter was the goblin being teased all along. maybe after this, he can better empathize with chasm since it seems like a similar mirror/storybeat.

malekith is a recurring villain in the comics and a huge threat to thor. the movie did him dirty. 

ultron is another recurring villain that somehow died in just one movie. absolutely heinous to his character. 

mordo became a loose end that they decided to ignore and do absolutely nothing with.

i am talking about villains who don't make sense as characters. i am not talking about a character with a simple motivation, if your actions fit your motive, it's fine. bullseye likes to kill people and get paid for it, he could make money legitimately elsewhere, but his love of violence prevents him from doing so, and that's fine.

so i am going to pick on two fantastic four villains, trapster and wizard. trapster's motive is supposed to be greed, but why didn't he just patent his glue and market it, he could have made millions legitimately, but didn't, for no good reason. trapster has nearly died several times, gets punched out by superheroes constantly, and has been subjected to ghost rider's penance stare and he is still a supervillain, why? the writers also can't decide whether he is a real serious supervillain or a comic relief character, pick one lane and go with it. either have trapster quit, up his game by a lot, and pick on a street-level character instead of a team that fights gods for a living or have him be a purely comic relief character. there is a prose novel short story from the 90s where trapster tries to reform, that is more interesting character work than anything that has been done with him in the comics, but it's not canon.

&amp;#x200b;

wizard is worse on this score, he has even less reason to be a public supervillain, if he wasn't a public supervillain with a record he would be a dangerous force in the business world. instead, he is a third-rate supervillain. he is jealous of the ff's fame and reed richard's abilities, but did he think becoming a public supervillain would make him more beloved than the ff? he is supposed to be smart, but he makes the same stupid mistakes over and over again, he always tries to defeat the ff with a frightful four instead of trying to overwhelm them with a frightful fourteen, he and the frightful do not seem remotely in the fantastic four's league. he's too evil to be sympathetic and not evil enough to actually be sinister or menacing. he is similar to the type of villains kid shows have been parodying for the last 20 years.

2370,my thoughts on phoenix saga,"**let me preface this by saying that this is the first time i have ever read an x-men comic of any kind. my experience with the x-men is solely due to the various animated shows and movies. after years of watching the mcu i decided to read marvel comics. i decided to start with x-men because i felt like the animated offerings were good to great but the movies, most of the time, were bad. i wanted to see what they were actually like.**

**now this doesn’t mean i am oblivious to x-men. i am proud to be a pretty nerdy guy so over the last 33 years of my life i have stumbled on comic art, comic book covers, and what i would consider light spoilers over that time.**

**after doing some research i decided to start from the very beginning for two reasons. 1) i thought it would be interesting to see how these characters change and evolve over time. 2) the original x-men comic was canceled which meant i didn’t have to read 200+ issues to hit uncanny x-men. i only had to make my way through 66.**

**previously i did review, or at least, my thoughts on the original x-men run.**

[https://new.reddit.com/r/marvel/comments/1buud2a/my\_thoughts\_on\_silver\_age\_xmen\_maybe\_light/] (https://new.reddit.com/r/marvel/comments/1buud2a/my_thoughts_on_silver_age_xmen_maybe_light/)

**if you are not interested in reading that, to sum it up, i overall liked it. way more than most people like the silver age x-men. i originally was going to do my thoughts on uncanny x-men omnibus vol 1 but i decided to forego that and instead do my thoughts on the phoenix saga which i am counting as staring on issue #101 and going up to #138**

**so without further ado let's get to it.**

issue 101: i have seen the cover of this issue before. the phoenix bursting out of the water. i know the loose cliff notes version of the phoenix saga in comics. this was my first time actually reading the story though and i will have to say the first couple pages are what i expected. jean grey crashed into the ocean before bursting forth from it. what i didn’t expect was afterwards her ending up in a hospital bed as cyclops stays by her side, the others go on a vacation.

honestly that was my biggest surprise about the phoenix saga how long it lasted. i could only imagine what it must have been like picking it up as they came out. overall a great start to the phoenix saga.

issue #105-#108: i have no idea if this is a hot take but after reading this arc and thinking back to the silver age i have realized something. i do not like when the x-men deal with aliens or go into space. i don’t even know what to say about this arc really. the alien civil war did nothing for me and finding out cyclop’s dad was corsair was a neat idea but i am about twelve issues into the uncanny omnibus vol 2 now and nothing has come of this yet. the ending was cool was the phoenix but other from that… eh.

**so the rest i will kind of shoot off the top of my head as the rest of what happens with phoenix is kind of scattered and peppered throughout.**

jason wyngarde was a very intriguing and interesting villain as is the idea of the black queen. the only question i have is… did he really not know she was phoenix? why did he just want jean grey? when the phoenix kills him i believe it is cyclops that says that jason had no idea phoenix was a thing but i swear jason was also the one that said that he had accounted for her getting mad and upset after he attacked cyclops. it was cool to see mastermind again though.

cyclops went from my least favorite x-men to one of my favorites. same with wolverine. in the beginning of chris clarmont’s run i couldn’t help but wonder why wolverine was so darn popular. by the time the volume 1 omnibus concluded i understood it. i would also like to do a re-read one day where i track when wolverine went from being an unruly asshole to giving off more loveable drunken uncle vibes.

storm is easily my new favorite x-men. enough said.

ok. enough mucking around let's talk about the actual event. i understand why the phoenix saga is so beloved now. a true epic. do i believe that there are better stories that have taken place in the comic medium since? yes. for the time though i understand why this was such a big deal and why people hold it in such high regard. the last five issues or so when the x-men walked into the hellfire club to cyclops recounting his time as an x-men and walking off is easily one the best stories i have had the pleasure to read. that is to say nothing of everything else.

i think the only thing i was slightly confused on is what phoenix was exactly? me reading issue after issue may have fuzzed some details. however, i can’t help but ask… it came from the solar flare, correct? it was obviously some cosmic entity and not like the movies portray where it is a part of her? if anyone can give me some insight into this that would be nice.

all in all i would give it 8.5.",Marvel,0,0.25,my thoughts on phoenix saga,"let me preface this by saying that this is the first time i have ever read an x men comic of any kind my experience with the x men is solely due to the various animated shows and movies after years of watching the mcu i decided to read marvel comics i decided to start with x men because i felt like the animated offerings were good to great but the movies most of the time were bad i wanted to see what they were actually like

ultron is another recurring villain that somehow died in just one movie. absolutely heinous to his character.

to me, ""the lost hunt"" was a light in the darkness during the wells run, and ""shadow of the green goblin"" was even better. jmd's voice for peter and everyone else was beyond impeccable. but one aspect that stood out to me, was peter being confused about his powers because he doesn't know their extent or how to control them yet, which leads him to wonder whether he was a hero or a monster. it felt like a very real look into a kid who suddenly got those powers.

anyways, an editor's note sent me to ""amazing spider-man family"", and i discovered a few stories by jmd that really scratched my itch. this excerpt shows one of peter's earliest heroics, and does a great job portraying the fear and confusion that a regular teenage boy, one not used to risking his life on a daily basis, would have to push through so early in his career as a superhero. in all of those stories, jmd really touched on stuff that the lee/ditko run didn't, and his stories fit like a glove.

\#1. green goblin  
in the midst of the superhuman civil war, the thunderbolts program was initiated to bring villains under government control, allowing them to essentially function as lawmen. norman osborn, aka the green goblin is specifically utilized as the registration leader iron man's own personal hitman. the first target tony sends the goblin after is a reporter named ben urich, who had begun uncovering financial secrets about stark, mainly that his company had been greatly profiting off this civil war. in hopes to ward ben off the case, tony sends the green goblin to attack him. \[1\] none of these threats seemed to work, and urich was able to quickly deduce that this was not the goblin acting on his own. despite this, i don't believe much ever came of urich's stories unfortunately if they did get published. during the war, for reasons i cannot remember, a great number of sleeper atlanteans began reawakening. i believe one group of these even caused an act of terrorism somewhere, but that may have been later during dark reign. when the avenger wonder man discovers this group of atlanteans amassing, iron man chooses to take drastic action. he the green goblin to privately take care of this atlantean matter as thoroughly and not connected to shield as possible. \[2\] the goblin trashes the atlanteans, and unfortunately wonder man as well who was caught up in everything. the atlantean threat is ended, and the green goblin seemingly goes free.

\#2. gaining power  
after the civil war, possibly for his successful work for stark, norman osborn is given a promotion to lead the thunderbolts he once was a member of. here, osborn works to reform villains into heroes supposedly (probably not). this time proves quite beneficial for norman, seemingly giving him control over his own mind again. when most heroes where distracted in the savage land during the secret invasion, norman and his thunderbolts work to save new york from invasion alongside whichever heroes were left. the rest of the heroes did eventually show up, but the army didn't fully surrender until their queen was assassinated by none other than norman osborn. \[3\] this put osborn in great standings with the media and public, and he was soon set to replace stark as the new head of national security, including shield, stark's technology, and, surprisingly, the avengers. now in charge of the protecting everyone, osborn renames shield to hammer (for no real reason) and begins making his own dark version of the avengers. he offers membership to the current mighty avengers, but the majority refuse to work for the former villain. the only exceptions are ares and sentry, the latter of which suffers from psychological issues which allows norman to relate to him. \[4\] despite being able to sympathize with the sentry, norman works throughout his dark reign to gain control of both the sentry and his alternate persona, the void.

\#3. dark avengers  
with his avengers roster found lacking, norman begins filling up the members with members of his former thunderbolts team. however, many of these members are well known villains, like bullseye and venom, so he gives each of them the mantles of well known heroes as disguises. norman even takes up a new heroic guise of his own thanks to having access to loads of stark's old armors. needing a symbol of hope for the team, he paints captain america colors on a more recent model of armor, calling himself the iron patriot! \[5\] although norman's avengers may now look like heroes, they're all still villains at heart (except for ares and sentry), and they begin to cause nothing but trouble for him. hawkeye (bullseye) kills a civilian in front of a news helicopter, spider-man (venom) has been eating body parts off of random villains, and of course norman can't have these hooligans disrupting his perfect image. fortunately for him, osborn is a master of public relations manipulation, and somehow he manages to avoid bad press every single time. in hopes to secure his power and gain more allies, osborn assembles some of the most powerful like-minded people in the community, such as doctor doom, loki, the hood, and more. \[6\] this alliance is full of mistrust and mostly doesn't work, but there are a few instances where they come to one another's aid. one such instance involves iron patriot travelling back in time with doctor doom, similar to how iron man had done earlier in the mighty avengers title.

\#4. breaking down  
this cabal of villains ultimately proves more trouble than it's worth for norman. loki in particular takes several major actions against osborn in order to cause mischief, all the while pretending to still be his ally. loki forms another team of mighty avengers, led by henry pym, who claims his team is the real avengers team as he is the only founding member leading. pym and his team infuriate loki to no end, and all the while loki is posing as the green goblin inside norman's mind in hopes of shattering his psyche once again. one of norman's big failures comes during the event known as utopia, where the mutants attempt to separate from humanity to form their own community. in attempts to thwart this, norman creates his own team of dark x-men to combat these mutants, but his allies from the cabal namor and emma frost turn against him, resulting in the mutants getting what they wish for. despite this loss, pr master norman osborn flips things around for the media and plays this off a win to be rid of the mutants. \[7\] osborn takes another huge hit to his mental state when the dark avengers encounter the villain known as the molecule man. in their attempts to stop the villain, each member of the dark avengers are placed into a kind of psychic prison, which proves immensely devastating to psychologically damaged people like the iron patriot or the sentry. \[8\] norman's right-hand lady victoria hand manages to talk the molecule man into surrender, and the day is seemingly saved.

\#5. how the mighty fall  
the avengers' battle against the molecule man, alongside the disbanding of the cabal, is essentially the breaking point for norman, a moment which is capitalized on by loki. \[9\] the god of mischief convinces osborn that asgard's current relocation to earth proves to be a threat to the common people, and norman is convinced he should strike against the asgardians. he attempts to get permission from the president, though he is turned down and warned. but ever the pr master manipulator, norman triggers an event involving the asgardian known as volstagg that results in immense loss of civilian lives. without permission from the president, the iron patriot uses this as an excuse to strike against asgard, assembling every possible force at his disposal to join in the fight. things begin to go badly once captain america arrives with every avenger available. iron patriot's helmet is knocked off, revealing green goblin paint underneath. \[10\] as a last ditch effort, osborn commands the sentry to crash asgard down to earth, which he does. sentry actually goes full void here, threatening the lives of everyone present, though this is ended after thor slays him. in the chaos, norman attempts to flee, but is caught by captain america. osborn and his allies are arrested, the rights to stark's tech and the avengers' name are restored, and captain america becomes the new head of national security, summoning in a new heroic age for the world.

round 1: base to base. spider-man is in his regular everyday suit, no special armor or weapons. batman has standard gear like his utility belt and other little stuff he carries around regular when fighting crime. they know nothing of each others abilities prior the fight

round 2: they both get 1 month prep-time with full knowledge of each other’s abilities. they can bring whatever equipment necessary to incapacitate or kill the other opponent.

r1: what is there to really settle about this. spider-man will speed blitz and one shot batman. spider-man is just so physically superior to batman in every way. batman has the advantage when it comes to biq and combat skill, but that stuff don’t matter when you are physically outclassed by 1000%. (i feel that peter has as good as, if not higher iq than batman)

r1: batman would most likely win based off what i’ve seen. however, let’s not downplay peter. even if you feel batman is smarter than peter, peter is still one of the smartest characters in marvel. we have seen time and time again that peter is able to formulate multi-step plans to take down. batman honestly only wins because of the “any equipment you want part”. if he pulls out the hellbat suit, it’s most likely wraps for peter. however, peter is very smart and has been shown to make amazing technology by himself. for all we know, he could make something to counter the hellbat. however, we haven’t really seen such a thing. so for right now, batman stomps.

2709,avengers and beyond vol 4 - ares,"hello! assuming you didn't see my first post (i ain't judging), i just read all of avengers volume 4, which includes new, young, dark, mighty, and more teams. i also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. i'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain avengers in the coming days, though i won't get to all of them. also, i should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! hopefully that adds something to the post. it might be a lot, but i hope you enjoy!

\#1. thor plus wolverine  
after the superhuman civil war, iron man is placed in charge of national security, including shield. and together with ms. marvel, these heroes form a new team of mighty avengers by picking the best of the best from all available heroes. there were several roles they wanted filled, two of which being a ""thor"" (god power) and a ""wolverine"" (ready to kill if the need arose). fortunately, ms. marvel knew just the person. the duo approaches ares, the olympian god of war and several time avengers foe. \[1\] despite their history, ares accepts their offer, partially because he's impressed by iron man's insistence, but also so that he can provide a better life for his earth-born son alex. the olympian immediately proves useful during a battle against giant subterranean monsters, but particularly useful in the mighty avengers' battle against ultron. the android takes over tony stark's biotech armor, reshaping his physical form to that of the wasp (ultron's ""mother""). doctor henry pym is called in as an ultron expert, and he develops a virus that should separate ultron from iron man's biology. however, this virus needed to be specifically injected inside ultron/stark's body. ares volunteers for the project, and he proves an excellent candidate thanks to his durability and battle skills as he fights against the robotic antibodies within. \[2\] though they nearly overwhelm him, ares is rescued by the wasp, and the pair escapes before ultron goes boom.

\#2. son of war  
the goes on many more missions, battling against symbiotes and doctor doom. the team is approached by jessica jones and her child who needed help, and ares adorably melted as soon as the baby arrived, presumably with memories of his own son. and speaking of ares' son alex, some time around now nick fury reaches out to alex. fury recruits the boy for his team of secret warriors, kind of a secret spy group loyal to fury, and ares is not made aware of this. even during the secret invasion, alex, fury, and the secret warriors are out on the front lines battling while ares and his team are off in the savage land dealing with their own thing. the mighty avengers do eventually return, but even up until the end ares does not discover his son's actions with fury. the secret invasion does finally end though when a man known as norman osborn assassinates the queen of the skrulls, and this man is celebrated as a war hero that even ares admires the accomplishments of. because of his heroism, the us government appoints norman as the new director of shield (soon renamed hammer) and national security. this role gives osborn the rights to the avengers name, and he extends membership to the current mighty avengers. ares in one of the only two to join alongside sentry as he admires norman as stated earlier. \[3\]

\#3. team shade  
despite his initial admiration, ares slowly begins to see the seedier side of osborn as time goes on and the dark avengers go on more missions. and while he's on the dark avengers, ares finally discovers that his son alex is working for nick fury. one day, ""on his way to school"", alex is followed by ares, who confronts nick fury and his secret warriors. \[4\] there is a brief battle, but fury and ares come to an understanding, and the god of war permits his son to work for fury as long as nick makes sure alex is not harmed. so around now, osborn sees an opportunity before himself. he happens to be in charge of hammer, the most prestigious group of combat trained agents in possibly the whole world, and he also has the olympian god of war on his payroll. norman gives ares his own personal pick of all the hammer agents so that he can create the most effective team of elite agents possible. \[5\] ares assembles a small band of men, and they are soon put to the test when ares hears word from his mother hera that his son has been injured and put in danger, which goes directly against his deal with fury. the group breaks into the shield base where they believe alex is being held, but they soon realize they were mistaken upon their arrival. it is not alex who was in peril, but another of ares' sons named kyknos, and he hopes to kill his father ares to become the new god of war. a battle of immortal proportions ensues, which kills not only kyknos, but also the men from ares' elite squad. \[6\]

\#4. gods and monsters  
in the final days of this volume, osborn begins planning a siege on the immortal nation of asgard, which has temporarily been displaced to midgard/earth. osborn wants them gone and he needs the aid of his own personal immortal to make the battle successful. by his nature, ares is greatly opposed to this plan, as the asgardians are a highly honored people among the gods. he initially refuses to aid osborn in his attack, even threatening to stop him if need be. \[7\] however, norman is a master of manipulation, and through deception he ultimately convinces ares to reluctantly lead his armies alongside him. not too much time goes by before the strike against asgard begins, and ares fights with all his might as you would expect from the god of war. things change when ares is informed of norman's deception. the god is enraged, and he immediately goes to attack osborn for tricking him into committing such a despicable act. \[8\] unfortunately for ares, osborn also has the sentry on his side, and the sentry has been manipulated into becoming his fully out of control void self. before ares gets to norman, sentry/void is instructed to protect him, and in this confrontation between ares and sentry, ares is torn in half and perishes at his former ally's hand. (google the image. it's epic, but i'm having trouble with the auto-mod already and don't want this post taken down.) osborn and the void are defeated, summoning a new heroic age, but at the cost of the life of an avenger.

2710,question about wolverine's immortality.,"so is logan immortal or just has a real streak of longevity? 

background to this so my friends were arguing that wolverine can't be immortal because hugh jackman is getting older. and that because jackman is getting older, it proves that eventually logan will die. of course, the basic problem with this, is that hugh jackman is a human being and not a comic book character. whereas logan from the comics is fictitious and can be young or old or whatever the writer wants. 

so within the main universe, excluding old man logan, excluding weird alternate futures, is wolverine immortal? could he theoretically live forever, or is there a set time limit baked into his character/ x-gene such as his body will break down after say 2,000 years and it's inevitable?

i'm probably not going to be able to settle the argument with my friends since they can't get over the incontrovertible fact that hugh jackman aging has nothing to do with the character aging. but it will put my own mind at rest if i could just hear what folks think overall.",Marvel,1,0.57,question about wolverine 's immortality,"so is logan immortal or just has a real streak of longevity

now for my questions. 

should i read all the new ultimates if i want the complete story? if yes, how do i do this cost effectively? 

are black panther and x-men the only other ones currently? will more be added? (hoping to see father murdock as ultimate dd)

what’s the difference between 1st/2nd/3rd prints? is it just the cover art? are 1st prints more coveted?

fantastic 4 and spider-man were set in different universes in the marvel animated universe (1990s)

in the fantastic four episode ""nightmare in green"", scarlet spider appears under an overhang watching rick jones and human torch fly by. this was because at the time of the series' production ben was the primary spider-man and peter was retired. however, this makes no sense within the marvel animated universe as ben never appeared in the primary universe, until “i really, really hate clones”. the logical explanation is that the fantastic four show is set in the same universe the scarlet spider comes from and subsequently the peter parker from the animated series has to save.

i am aware that the fantastic four do appear in secret wars , but they could just be similar alternative versions. this also explains why spider-man wasn’t affected by the arrival of galactus. also their costumes are different.

2772,avengers and beyond vol 4 - spider-women,"hello! assuming you didn't see my first post (i ain't judging), i just read all of avengers volume 4, which includes new, young, dark, mighty, and more teams. i also read any related annuals, miniseries, or whatever involved with these titles. i'll be posting the highlights of this run for certain avengers in the coming days, though i won't get to all of them. also, i should mention that whenever you see a number \[#\], there's an image to go along with it! hopefully that adds something to the post. it might be a lot, but i hope you enjoy! i should also mention that this and the hank pym posts are the only ones i've had to re-upload due to auto-mod interference, so maybe they have something against skrull imposters. anyway...

\#1. secret agent  
a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a group of alien skrulls prophesied a day of great destruction for their people, as well as a blue beacon of hope on another planet. something like that, they didn't get into it too much to where i remembered great detail. this group was lead by a skrull woman named veranke, but her and her people were cast out for their prophecies. \[1\] one day, however, the force of nature known as galactus showed up at the skrull's homeworld and had a big yummy meal, which meant their primary world was as good as dead. skrulls all began to realize that the prophecies of veranke and her group were truth, and she was soon elected queen of the skrull empire. as new leader of the skrulls, veranke set her sights on secretly invading the great blue planet earth so her people could make it their new homeworld. using data gathered from when a group called the illuminati attempted to threaten them, the skrulls began replacing earthlings one by one, perfectly replicating both their memories as well as any superpowers they may have had while becoming completely undetectable by any type of science, magic, or seemingly anything. some agents were even given the powers of multiple heroes to become super-skrulls, but we don't see much of these agents until a little later on. veranke herself desired to get involved, wanting a role that would cause the most damage. the earthling known as jessica drew, aka spider-woman, was selected due to her ties with both shield and hydra. \[2\] as jessica, veranke had a rare close relationship with the ultra-secretive nick fury, former director of shield and current wanted outlaw. working for nick, veranke worked for both hydra and shield as a double-agent for both, but truly only answering to fury.

\#2. alien avenger  
during a tour or something (not super explained) of the raft, superhuman shield agent jessica drew is assigned to escort luke cage, matt murdock, and foggy nelson to the lower areas of the superhuman prison known as the raft. not long after these guests arrive, however, a complete blackout occurs, allowing all of the villains held here to break out. heroes like spider-man, captain america, and iron man soon arrive to help our heroes, and soon the breakout is quelled. several villains manage to escape, but the day is mostly saved. this event inspires captain america to assemble a new team of avengers, and he asks jessica/veranke to be one of the members. already tied up with shield and hydra, as well as her own skrull schemes, she checks in with the likes of madame hydra and nick fury before accepting. when both nerds want their own mole in the avengers, jessica agrees to join these new avengers. \[3\] here she ""reunites"" with an old friend, jessica jones, who is currently in a relationship with luke cage. though she is now an avenger, veranke still has meetings in secret with her fellow skrull agents. anywho, spider-woman and the avengers make it their mission to recover those villains who escaped from the raft that night. they head to the savage land to recover sauron, and while there they discover a splinter group of shield agents stealing resources from the area. these rogue agents are locked away by the avengers, aided by wolverine who joins the team, and it's never discovered that these rogue agents were actually skrulls in disguise.

\#3. everything goes wrong  
next, the new avengers head to japan to recapture silver samurai, who seems to be renewing his relationship with the villainous madame hydra. the avengers arrive and defeat both villains, but let silver samurai go free when it's discovered the raft had faked his death and were keeping him unlawfully. still, the avengers do get to go back with madame hydra in tow. spider-woman is still attempting to be heroic, but is forced to free madame hydra in order to keep her cover. \[4\] she almost gets away with it too, if it wasn't for that meddling captain america, who catches a glimpse of what jessica did. the next day, while at breakfast, steve confronts her about this and why she freed madame hydra. getting the ok from fury, she informs cap and the rest of the avengers about her messy alliances with both shield and hydra, though chooses to keep her little green secret to herself. the avengers find it harder to trust her now, but seem to understand and keep her on their team. later, after a meeting between the avengers and the x-men, both teams head off to find the scarlet witch. before they arrive, reality is reset into a world where mutants rule as a majority. mutants are one of the biggest problems that the skrulls faced as part of their infiltration, so this sudden change is devastating to invasion plans. though most heroes don't seem to recall this change, the skrull agents do. veranke has a meeting with skrull agent criti-noll, who is disguised as yellowjacket, and the two discuss their options. \[5\] they agree to let this play out and pray that reality reverts to how it was, trusting the heroes of earth to fix everything while planning to assassinate the witch. the heroes manage to fix things without wanda's death, and as the reality they knew returns, the scarlet witch who was responsible for this also greatly decreases the amount of mutants on earth. this result is an immense step forward for the skrulls' invasion plans, though the annihilation wave is a huge loss for their people.

\#4. secret no more  
the superhuman civil war shatters the remainder of earth's heroes, splitting the super community in half. tony stark and maria hill (current director of shield) attempt to trick spider-woman with a life model decoy of nick fury, hoping to get her to reveal the location of nick fury. \[6\] jess sees through this and escapes after a hydra attack, joining up with the outlaw heroes and remaining with their avengers team when the war comes to an end. initially unsure of what to do next, the new avengers soon decide to rescue their ally maya lopez, who they had left behind in japan so she could continue monitoring criminal activities over there. they discover maya had been captured by the hand and brainwashed so she fought the avengers alongside the hand. the avengers helped free her, and as revenge, echo kills the hand's leader elektra. elektra falls to the ground, revealing that she had been a skrull imposter this whole time. realizing the invasion has begun, the new avengers can no longer trust one another, and veranke is absolutely shaking in her boots, though remaining as collected as she needs to be to keep her cover. at first opportunity, she makes a run for it with the skrull elektra corpse, bringing it directly to iron man, the new director of shield after maria hill. \[7\] now both the new avengers and the mighty avengers are disrupted, which is only helped when tony offers jessica a place on his team. after a few weeks, spider-woman is confronted by wolverine directly. by the end, he's somewhat convinced that she's not a skrull, but dashes when her teammate black widow shows up. not much comes from this encounter, but both iron man and wolverine seem convinced she's human.

\#5. out with the new, in with the old  
when stark hears reports of a skrull ship landing in the savage land, he and his team head out there to investigate. veranke makes sure the outlaw avengers are also made aware, and both teams arrive on the scene. a slew of heroes pour out of the skrull ship claiming to be the original versions. before the confrontation, all of stark's tech shuts off at once (thanks to the hank pym skrull from before). ms. marvel hides tony away in a cave to recover, so veranke uses this moment to take advantage of tony's moment of weakness. she attempts to trick him, convincing stark that he has been a high-up skrull leader all this time. \[8\] she fails to convince him however, and she's scared off by several avengers who have discovered how to tell who is and isn't a skrull. while these skrulls had been keeping our heroes busy, an army of super-skrulls had begun invading new york, which is where veranke heads next. the heroes arrive, turning the tides, and making the skrull invaders desperate. after their last ditch effort plan is foiled, veranke is taken down for good by norman osborn, which seems to end the invasion. \[9\] iron man locates the captives held by the skrulls, and jessica drew is returned to earth. wolverine invites the real jessica to take house with the outlaw avengers, though there is some initial pushback. wolvie reminds his teammates that jess isn't the skrull queen any more, and their tone soon shifts as they can't judge her for the skrull's actions. after jess joins, she risks her life as part of a plot to lure the dark avengers out into a trap, but the trap turns on the avengers when osborn sends the hood's men after her instead. the avengers make it out of this ambush just barely thanks to a combo attack with jess and ms. marvel. there was also a cool plot where she teamed up with spider-man, even briefly battling him when mandrill took over her mind. but she broke free of his control with spider-man's help and kicked his butt, and that's really about all till the end of the volume. \[10\]

 during a tour or something not super explained of the raft superhuman shield agent jessica drew is assigned to escort luke cage matt murdock and foggy nelson to the lower areas of the superhuman prison known as the raft not long after these guests arrive however a complete blackout occurs allowing all of the villains held here to break out heroes like spider man captain america and iron man soon arrive to help our heroes and soon the breakout is quelled several villains manage to escape but the day is mostly saved this event inspires captain america to assemble a new team of avengers and he asks jessica veranke to be one of the members already tied up with shield and hydra as well as her own skrull schemes she checks in with the likes of madame hydra and nick fury before accepting when both nerds want their own mole in the avengers jessica agrees to join these new avengers \[3\ here she reunites with an old friend jessica jones who is currently in a relationship with luke cage though she is now an avenger veranke still has meetings in secret with her fellow skrull agents anywho spider woman and the avengers make it their mission to recover those villains who escaped from the raft that night they head to the savage land to recover sauron and while there they discover a splinter group of shield agents stealing resources from the area these rogue agents are locked away by the avengers aided by wolverine who joins the team and it 's never discovered that these rogue agents were actually skrulls in disguise 

 \#3 everything goes wrong  
 next the new avengers head to japan to recapture silver samurai who seems to be renewing his relationship with the villainous madame hydra the avengers arrive and defeat both villains but let silver samurai go free when it 's discovered the raft had faked his death and were keeping him unlawfully still the avengers do get to go back with madame hydra in tow spider woman is still attempting to be heroic but is forced to free madame hydra in order to keep her cover \[4\ she almost gets away with it too if it was for that meddling captain america who catches a glimpse of what jessica did the next day while at breakfast steve confronts her about this and why she freed madame hydra getting the ok from fury she informs cap and the rest of the avengers about her messy alliances with both shield and hydra though chooses to keep her little green secret to herself the avengers find it harder to trust her now but seem to understand and keep her on their team later after a meeting between the avengers and the x men both teams head off to find the scarlet witch before they arrive reality is reset into a world where mutants rule as a majority mutants are one of the biggest problems that the skrulls faced as part of their infiltration so this sudden change is devastating to invasion plans though most heroes do seem to recall this change the skrull agents do veranke has a meeting with skrull agent criti noll who is disguised as yellowjacket and the two discuss their options \[5\ they agree to let this play out and pray that reality reverts to how it was trusting the heroes of earth to fix everything while planning to assassinate the witch the heroes manage to fix things without wanda 's death and as the reality they knew returns the scarlet witch who was responsible for this also greatly decreases the amount of mutants on earth this result is an immense step forward for the skrulls invasion plans though the annihilation wave is a huge loss for their people 

 \#4 secret no more  
 the superhuman civil war shatters the remainder of earth 's heroes splitting the super community in half tony stark and maria hill current director of shield attempt to trick spider woman with a life model decoy of nick fury hoping to get her to reveal the location of nick fury \[6\ jess sees through this and escapes after a hydra attack joining up with the outlaw heroes and remaining with their avengers team when the war comes to an end initially unsure of what to do next the new avengers soon decide to rescue their ally maya lopez who they had left behind in japan so she could continue monitoring criminal activities over there they discover maya had been captured by the hand and brainwashed so she fought the avengers alongside the hand the avengers helped free her and as revenge echo kills the hand 's leader elektra elektra falls to the ground revealing that she had been a skrull imposter this whole time realizing the invasion has begun the new avengers can no longer trust one another and veranke is absolutely shaking in her boots though remaining as collected as she needs to be to keep her cover at first opportunity she makes a run for it with the skrull elektra corpse bringing it directly to iron man the new director of shield after maria hill \[7\ now both the new avengers and the mighty avengers are disrupted which is only helped when tony offers jessica a place on his team after a few weeks spider woman is confronted by wolverine directly by the end he 's somewhat convinced that she 's not a skrull but dashes when her teammate black widow shows up not much comes from this encounter but both iron man and wolverine seem convinced she 's human 

 \#5 out with the new in with the old  
 when stark hears reports of a skrull ship landing in the savage land he and his team head out there to investigate veranke makes sure the outlaw avengers are also made aware and both teams arrive on the scene a slew of heroes pour out of the skrull ship claiming to be the original versions before the confrontation all of stark 's tech shuts off at once thanks to the hank pym skrull from before ms marvel hides tony away in a cave to recover so veranke uses this moment to take advantage of tony 's moment of weakness she attempts to trick him convincing stark that he has been a high up skrull leader all this time \[8\ she fails to convince him however and she 's scared off by several avengers who have discovered how to tell who is and is a skrull while these skrulls had been keeping our heroes busy an army of super skrulls had begun invading new york which is where veranke heads next the heroes arrive turning the tides and making the skrull invaders desperate after their last ditch effort plan is foiled veranke is taken down for good by norman osborn which seems to end the invasion \[9\ iron man locates the captives held by the skrulls and jessica drew is returned to earth wolverine invites the real jessica to take house with the outlaw avengers though there is some initial pushback wolvie reminds his teammates that jess is the skrull queen any more and their tone soon shifts as they ca judge her for the skrull 's actions after jess joins she risks her life as part of a plot to lure the dark avengers out into a trap but the trap turns on the avengers when osborn sends the hood 's men after her instead the avengers make it out of this ambush just barely thanks to a combo attack with jess and ms marvel there was also a cool plot where she teamed up with spider man even briefly battling him when mandrill took over her mind but she broke free of his control with spider man 's help and kicked his butt and that 's really about all till the end of the volume \[10\

2781,"does x-men ‘97 stand alone? in other words, can it be someone’s first x-media?","i’ve been thinking about this ever since last week’s phenomenal episode. x-men ‘97 has quickly become a goat comics show for me, along with the 90’s dcau. but where those dc shows can stand on there own as an intro to those characters, even with no familiarity with the comics, i don’t think the same can be said of x-men ‘97 and that’s unfortunate, if unavoidable.

x97 is a direct continuation of a much lesser show that has 5 seasons of kiddie cornball tv production stories. a person who has never seen or read anything x-men is probably not going to be moved to watch it, nor should they. but a familiarity with these characters in some form does seem to be a prerequisite for 97, if nothing else. going into the show knowing the basic relationships, struggles, histories, etc.

this problem came to my mind as i was considering whether a friend would enjoy ‘97. she doesn’t read comics or watch comic book movies and she was born in 98, so way after the 90s cartoons were relevant and even too young to be much aware of the early 00’s comic book movie boom. but, she has been getting into watching animation lately. she really loved both of the spider-verse films and she recently saw paprika and loved that too. 

i think she would dig ‘97 if she could follow it but i also think she would be totally lost. i know she won’t read the comics or watch the old show. i’m not even sure i could get her to sit through the original movies, or if i’d even want her too because they are all pretty dated and, imo, inferior to 97. don’t want to scare her off the idea!

2818,would you guys accept newsprint if it meant cheaper and bigger comics?,"so i think one thing we all agree on is that sometimes comics can be a bit on the expensive side. especially if you want to follow an entire line of books like the x-men. which makes sense considering the quality of the paper they're printed on. 

but let's ask a hypothetical. if marvel switched back to newsprint paper, which is relatively cheaper to print, about 48 pages per issue, and price at about $1.99 usd, would you guys be down for it?

i would be. i think each individual issue being twice as big can help with some of the pacing issues some modern comics have. and producing it on cheaper paper would help keep the cost of each issue reasonable. 

plus, with comics being priced at two dollars an issue, that's 10 comics for just $20. you can't tell me that's not a good deal.
