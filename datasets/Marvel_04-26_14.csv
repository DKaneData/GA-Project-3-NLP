70s and 80s style not suiting,"Hi... Over the last two years, I have bought a number of marvel epic collections. The whole idea behind this purchase was to enjoy reading the stories from the very beginning and in a warped way, I thought I would like those old stories more than the modern style of storytelling. 

Turns out after reading a couple of epics as well as modern takes on characters like Immortal Hulk and Garth Ennis' The Punisher, I like the modern style more than the older campy ones. Now I am stuck with a bunch of epics covering the initial runs of characters and I generally feel like selling them off. What do you suggest? Any advice will be appreciated as I feel I have splurged quite a lot on the epics and feel guilty as they lie gathering dust on my shelves.... Sorry if this feels like a rant ",Marvel,1,0.6

Spider-Man live action series (1977),"Starring Nicholas Hammond as Peter Parker the 1977-79 Spider-Man series aired sporadically for two seasons and 12 episodes  after airing a successful 90 minute pilot.

Due to concern over the series not attracting an older demographic, CBS ordered five first season and seven second season episodes which aired in no set time slot.

The series was ultimately cancelled due to CBS not wanting to be known as the comic book show network due to them already airing Wonder Woman, The Incredible Hulk and airing pilots of Dr. Strange and Captain America.

My problem with EMH S1E10 (Everything is Wonderful),"It's the ""MODOC"" (yeah, with a C in this case) episode.

He heard the man begging, he heard the man threatening, all he needed to do was saying the exact words he said after the guy ""died"" and ruined his own life.

I know he's not a social genious but, come on, he should be written better than ""Oh I was too distracted to tell the only important piece of information in the whole conversation that clearly had a man begging me to help him"". It wasn't even like he was doing something important, he was casually fiddling with whaveter the hell that sphere was, and all he really need to say was ""I bought your company to save it"" followed by ""You'll still be in charge of it"".",Marvel,1,1.0
Update on Daredevil by me.,"So the other day I posted some design ideas I had for a Daredevil suit. And now I've drawn a rough sketch of my design. I wanted to make the suit a rusty red sort of color and I think it turned out good, as well as the mask and horns which were the main parts I wanted to change from other suits. In the final version I'll probably bring the mask down lower.

In the final version I'm going to try and make the color blending better, work on my anatomy, and fix a few small issues such as the rosary being messed up the billy clubs being too small, and the beard and hair (I drew this in pen first not intending to add color so thats why the beard is black with some orange colored over it.)

So please tell me what you think. And any more experienced artists who have any tips especially for anatomy (specifically legs) please leave them below.

Malekith is a recurring villain in the comics and a HUGE threat to Thor. The movie did him dirty. 

Ultron is another recurring villain that somehow died in just one movie. Absolutely heinous to his character. 

Mordo became a loose end that they decided to ignore and do absolutely nothing with. 

Gorr was a MENACE in his small section of the Thor God of Thunder run. He almost killed 3 different iterations of Thor that teamed up to kill him. He killed so many Gods and even brought down Omnipotence City. 

Vision just got his ass beat in every scene hes in after Age of Ultron and brought absolutely nothing to the table despite being one of the most powerful characters in the Avengers.
