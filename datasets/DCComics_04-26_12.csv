Should Barry Allen be older or younger?,"So I have been working on a big DC Universe fancast for several years now at this point, but I started wondering this question recently. How old should Barry Allen be?

I should note I had set this fancast universe to have started in 2013, just to work with some actors at certain ages. I had Dylan O'Brien locked in for a while now, but recently other castings I started doing for Nightwing and such have made me start wondering about other casting ideas. 

Anyways the main point is that it got me thinking about what Barry's accepted age range should be? Either in his early to mid 20s, or around is early to mid 30s. Because I think the two recent live action iterations have contributed to this confusion. Grant Gustin was 23 when he first started playing Barry Allen, and Ezra Miller was 22. As well, other Barry's have been depicted as younger recently as well, like Kill the Justice League Barry who says he is youngest member and acts like it.

But then there has been other depictions where he is shown as older. Like John Wesley Shipp was 35 when he first played Barry. As well several other versions from cartoons and games is shown as older at least, like Young Justice, the Tomorrowverse, Batman The Brave and the Bold and Injustice.

So I've become a little confused about this then, especially since age in comics is weird. If you add Wally into the mix when he becomes Flash, then Barry should be older, but then lately they show him as younger. 

I don't know. I was wondering if anyone had a answer to this? Like do the comics point to him being a definitive age range among the League? Or does it possibly not matter, he can be either based on your preference, considering all these different depictions.",DCcomics,1,0.54

So what about Absolute Power was “30 years in the making” exactly?,"Now that we have full details about this summer’s event Absolute Power, we can safely say that the initial teaser/marketing was a total lie.

People speculated that the event was a sequel to Zero Year or that it had something to do with Parallax but it has nothing to do with anything that took place 30 years ago.

Also it was stated that Mark Waid was gonna be writing all “25 issues” of the event, which we know isn’t true. He is only writing the main series.

Is DC this desperate for sales that they are relying on lies to sell books to the fans or did they think we’d just forget about these lies after they generated enough hype around it?",DCcomics,97,0.82

Guys need opinions on a decision related to comics ,"So as I have mentioned before I'm a old comics fan I have read both marvel and DC even some image and valiant. I used to read comics a lot during my teenage years, years ago but I stopped and been reading only manga for a while but lately I have been getting the feeling to return to comics which I kinda did since last week I have been reading Superman and action comics 90s since I didn't get to read them years ago I've only read Superman 2000s, new 52 and rebirth . 

And I still enjoy comics so I'm confused whether to fully return to comics or stay sticking only to manga like I have been since years now since doing both will overwhelming I still got a lot manga on my reading list I plan to read if I add also comics I'll be overwhelmed especially for DC . As for marvel I have already read nearly every marvel character their 90s, 2000s, 2010s comics I only got newerer current marvel comics to read . DC I have read a lot of it too in the past but not everything there's still some older DC titles I didn't read besides the newer current titles .

So if anyone wants to give their opinion what to choose whether manga or comics ? ",DCcomics,0,0.31

[Discussion] Is DC using a cover artist that is using AI?,"This artist, Leirix ([who has an instagram that shows her making art pre-AI, as well as traditional art pieces](https://instagram.com/leirixart)), has done a lot of variant covers for DC (and Marvel), but to me these cover arts all kind of scream AI. Take a look at Wonder Woman #5:

[Notice Wonder Woman's hand, as well as the thumb on the peace sign. The mouths being drawn that way also seems very common in recent stable diffusion AI pieces.](https://preview.redd.it/pjlxfca81xvc1.jpg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b825ca8aa9cb22d1e5eca5e4772a4b78bc123697)

Flash #8 has this art:

[Look at the hands of Irey West on her waist, the line art of both characters also seems extremely inconsistent with normal digital artwork, like on the back of Jessie's leg.](https://preview.redd.it/e8a08da81xvc1.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=772d3e5028a45047b4a101e0a1428198323e16fb)

People obviously hyperfixate on hands now adays to argue AI, but I also think jewelry is overlooked as an indicator. This artwork of Harley Quinn is what completely sold me. Look at her necklace.

I had a question that has been boggling my mind for a while now. I thought of this question while I was watching the animated film The Batman vs. Dracula. I wanted to know who were the greatest human scientific minds in the DC Universe. Who are the most brilliant human scientists the DCU has to offer? Could you guys, kindly, tell me who you think should be on that list? I assume Bruce Wayne is somewhere on that list because…he's Batman. Could you guys also tell me your reasoning as to why a particular person should be on the list?

Thanks, fellow DC fans. Have a great one, everybody!

My DCU (Chapter 1: Gods on Earth- Act 1),"Hey everyone! I’m kinda new here, but this idea has been brewing in my mind for a while! DC is one of my favorite franchises EVER, and I’ve always wanted to see a complete, linear, epic series of movies and shows for it like what Marvel has! Only problem is that so far, the DCEU was kinda... not good, and not what I’d wanted. I’m confident that James Gunn has a good plan in mind, but that’s his vision, and this is mine! I will be following the Apokolips saga path that Snyder and the animated movies followed, but it will be my own version completely separate from both projects (for the most part)! This is only my first phase (or act as I like to call it), but I hope you all enjoy and I can tell you about more!

The projects are in the following order, in case anyone is curious:

1. Superman: The Man of Tomorrow (film)
2. Batman: The Caped Crusaders (film)
3. Wonder Woman and the Justice Society (film)
4. Nightwing (film)
5. The Flash: Fastest Man Alive (film)
6. Green Lantern: Emerald Guardian (film)
7. Aquaman: King of Atlantis (film)
8. Justice League: Unite (film)

Discussion about the Crisis on Two Earths animated movie," SPOILERS maybe. The discussion is about an important quote from the movie.  


 TL;DR I think the peak-you-blinked-scene may be not that peak, since what I've learned about Nietzsche's quote is that actually Batman would be the one who blinked in this metaphor.

  
 When I first watched the movie I thought the use of Nietzsche's catchphrase was very peak (he was known for using it when he went to fight crime and stuff). It's been used in a lot of superhero stuff, it's in Watchmen, it's in like 40 Batman stuff, it's in the beginning of the Infinity Gauntlet too if I'm not mistaken.

&amp;#x200B;

  Batman tells that the difference between him and Owlman is that both stared at the abyss, but Owlman blinked. The original quote from Beyond Good &amp; Evil and the sentence before is:  


 ""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee. ""  


 I believe this means that if you stare into the abyss for long enough, get your hands too dirty, per say, you'll be inevitably changed by the things you're trying to deal with, maybe become a part of it. So... If Batman is the guy who can deal with the horrors of Gotham and doesn't become an cold blooded assassin and Owlman is the one who was inevitably changed by all of this and became a nihilist who doesn't care about the importance of life, Batman should be the one who blinked and Owlman should be the one who stared into the abyss for too long.  


My question is, is Friedrich Nietzsche stupid? Did he not read the Infinity Gauntlet?   


Now seriously, do you have another interpretation of this scene that is more compatible? I'm seriously thinking the writers of the movie just didn't dive in the metaphor deep enough to see that the point was that Batman doesn't gaze into the abyss long enought for it to gaze back at him.

On Earth, in Star City, 25-year-old, Kyle Rayner, is a struggling artist, who works part-time as a janitor for an organization called Cadmus. While walking home, Kyle finds Ganthet withering in an alleyway. Ganthet uses his ring to scan Kyle and determine that he's a worthy host. Kyle is given the ring before Ganthet dies in the alley.

Over the next couple of days, Kyle is learning how to use his ring. Ganthet uploads his consciousness into the ring and acts as a mentor (like Obi-Wan Kenobi). As Kyle is training, he learns that Cadmus discovered a meteor from deep space, which has unusual energy signals within it. Cadmus's head scientist, Hector Hammond, opens the meteor and is infected with Parallax's fear virus. Hector is now under the command of Parallax and infects all the Cadmus employees with the fear virus. Hector and the infected employees plan to use Cadmus's dark matter energy core to create a wormhole that will directly link to OA so that Parallax can release his fear virus on Earth from OA.

Kyle decides to accept his role as Green Lantern and goes to stop Hector. There's a very violent battle at The Cadmus Facility, all the fear-infected individuals fight Kyle with everything they can. However, Hector creates the wormhole and Parallax begins to release his fear virus. Kyle uses his ring to block the wormhole but he knows he can't do it for long. After some encouragement from Ganthet, Kyle manages to close the wormhole and save Earth. In the end, Kyle becomes Earth's protector.

Throughout the film, we see a romance between Kyle and Alexandra DeWitt, a photographer at the local paper. At the end of the film, they hook up.

Anyway, that's the plot, a big improvement on my last draft. Also, it'd still be an Elseworld Movie, with no Justice League or big superhero teams, except for easter eggs and references to Superman, Alan Scott, Martian Manhunter, and The JSA.

  
Post Credit Scene:

Kyle hovers over Star City, but he's approached by an unknown figure who's also levitating. Kyle turns around to see Alan Scott, dawned in his iconic red outfit and green cape, wearing a power ring. ""You're not the only Lantern left,"" Alan says.

Questions about Caitlin Fairchild's Powers and Age (CONFUSED),"FYI, yes, I know there's more than one version of this character, cause it originally belonged to Wildstorm, then Wildstorm got sold to DC, etc, etc.

My question is about the current version of the character, the one in the DC Comics Universe (that is also a clone apparently...)

In these images you can see that when Caitlin isn't using her powers, she looks like a literal kid, a child, a brat,. But when she uses her powers, not only she gets harder, better, faster, stronger, etc, **she also transforms into a grown woman.**

**I went to the wiki for clarification on what was going on,** **to see if it was a Billy Batson situation,** but seeing the powers listed on the wiki not only did not explain what was going on, they also managed to leave me even more confused.

It mentions a **""Transformation""** and a **""Superhuman Form""** but it explicitly states that **all this transformation does is it enhances her muscle mass, and as a result that enhances her physical attributes** (again... harder, better, faster, stronger, etc,). with all that out of the way my questions are:

**If what supposedly happens when Caitlin transforms is she gets more buff with muscle mass, then why does she get taller, looks older and gain bigger boobs?**

Is the clone ""**original form""** the **little girl?** or is it the **grown woman?**

...what is going on?

How do I read the comics online?,"I'm just getting into the DC comics and I don't know where to find them to read them online.

Superboy (1994 3rd Series) Review 0-100,"I just did a reread of one of my favorites as a kid. I entered the hobby at the Death of Superman and read Knightfall, but the first series that I felt was mine, that I was excited to read each month of Superboy by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett.

You can essential divide the run into 4 parts. The first part 1-30 is (largely) Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett. It tells the story of Superboy's establishing himself as he hero of Hawaii, his relationship with Tana Moon, and a wonderful cast of characters (Dubbilex, Rex and Roxie Leach, Knockout) culminating in the 6 part Losin' It storyline where Superboy nearly throws it all away. It's a great run marred only by the loss of Grummett for most of the Losin' It issues. It spans World's Collide (Milestone universe), the Zero Hour, and Underworld Unleashed events.

The second part is largely written by Ron Marz running from 31-49. I remember being a little disappointed that Kesel and Grummett had left the title, and actually stopped buying it at issue 41. It was years later that I picked up another chunk and rereading them now, it's not as bad. There are a few major elements that come out of this run, the climatic storyline being the five parter Meltdown. There is an issue in the Final Night storyline too.

The third part is the (triumphal) return to the title by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett, running from 50-79. I didn't return to the title because my teenage funds were limited and I was buying Image at the time, but the lot I picked up had Marz's and most of Kesel's run. On first reading it didn't get me back to that level of excitement I had when I was a teen, but on this read through I really enjoyed it. Lots of fun storytelling, new characters, a new situations. Living at Cadmus lent itself to encountering the New Gods, and getting involved in the wider DC world. There's a couple of big storylines Hyper-Tension is a 6 parter, and then the climactic Sins of Youth crossover. There's also a Day of Judgement event tie-in.

The final part runs from 80-100, primarily written by Joe Kelly and then a team-up of Palmiotti and Didio. This was the part that prompted my rereading because when I first read it, I didn't have an appreciation of Kelly at all. But after enjoying some of his other works, I began to suspect that maybe I was being too harsh on it. I wasn't a fan of the art and sometimes that can ruin the whole book. Unfortunately, the book is as bad as I remember. It is aimless, full of lame humor, taking Superboy away from his supporting cast that had been developed for 80 issues, from a dynamic story setting at Cadmus to a dreary setting as the caretaker of an apartment complex. I'm not against big shifts, but it's hard to see this as anything more than a desperation to keep it going to achieve 100 issues. It's bad and a sad end to a mostly strong run.

Down the road, I'll happily recommend the first 82 issues, but I advise you to drop it once Kelly arrives.",DCcomics,8,0.76

What if DC were to obtain the Irredeemable series?,"For starters I've recently just finished the Irredeemable omnibus and absolutely loved the story, but afted finishing it a question came to mind, in regards to the ending. In the Irredeemable comic-verse they make a cheeky little easter egg where the plutonians death causes the inspiration for what seems to be Superman and it got me thinking, what if DC were to obtain Irredeemable or even just the plutonian? Would they keep his story to be basically the same and turn him into the omniversal inspiration for every Superman in the current DC universe or would DC try to rewrite his character to be just a completely new Evil ""Superman""?",DCcomics,0,0.27

So where should I start?,"I'm just now getting into DC comics....yea I know I'm late but like....Im here now lol

There are so many different DC universes that I don't know where I'm going like at all.

I want to start with Batman, cuz Batmans fucking awesome, I know the basics yk his back story, justice league, his kids, biological and adopted.

Like what's the cannon series before I diverge into other universe if there are any, like I don't understand the timeline at all.

So like I know about Jason Todd, and Nightwing, and Damian and they're ☠️ right? Or did Jason Todd come back and become the dude with the red mask.. isn't he just red or something.....

I think this is the place to ask this question so like lemme know! None of my friends are into this and the one guy that was my friend who does know stuff about this literally said to my face that I couldn't possibly understand the comics...so I'm relying on you reddit!
