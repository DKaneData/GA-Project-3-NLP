"Halfway Through Spider-Verse TP, Am I Crazy Or Is It Out Of Order??","So like halfway in I realize things aren’t lining up right, i run back and check the chronological reading order at the beginning and realize that’s not how the book is actually laid out.

How conceptual does the One Above All go?,"
For example, is he someone a human character can actually talk to? Not talk to an avatar but the entire being of the One Above All. Does he have emotions and a personality? 

Or is it more conceptual? 

Conceptual as in like all characters are the One Above All because the One Above All is everything and everywhere. So that means the timelines, the clothes that people wear, the concept of brushing teeth, the being of Eternity, and everything and every thought in the multiverse and beyond are all apart of the One Above All’s “body”. In this scenario Doctor Strange cannot defeat the One Above All because if Strange shot a fireball at him, technically that fireball is the One Above All and so is Doctor Strange and the air he breathes, so it would basically do nothing. In this case, he is angry, happy, sad, vengeful, enlightened, depressed, hungry, and full all at the same time and yet he isn’t feeling anything as well, he is literally (by the definition of literally) nothing and everything at once.

Hyperion's bond with Thor would be great to return.,"Always liked how Hyperion became the brother Thor never had.

https://preview.redd.it/8j2tb8ws1fwc1.png?width=1421&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2f358e0d6962c2154f908ca0b7e2ed5e82118bb

During their time together, the two quickly became close friends, with  Hyperion providing a shoulder for Thor to rely on after the events of *Original Sin* stripped him of his ability to lift Mjolnir. Hyperion remained a  companion even when the world faced the end of all things in ""Time Runs  Out.""  

It's pretty obvious how Hyperion also started to grow as he got accustomed to this new world and to the God way more than refering each other as Brothers.

[Hyperion constantly accept\/asking for a share of what Thor drinks is a great touch to symbolise their friendship.](https://preview.redd.it/sgvskzlw1fwc1.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d88f426992014e7120af75afc25fd54c37eca830)

The Children of the Sun begged their adopted father to stay. Hyperion refused to let his best friend go into the unknown without proper backup. Hyperion even came to call Thor his brother, signifying just how  important they came to be to one another. In their final battle, the  pair fought side by side wounded and with an entire army of Beyonders moving to attack them, the pair met their ends as brothers in arms, even vowing to find one another in Valhalla.

It's a great touch of the Hickman run on Avengers and the Incursions  saga as a whole, giving Thor and Hyperion someone they can fully relate to and actually relax around. He enjoyed a stint on a briefly-lived version of Squadron Supreme, found a civilian life as a truck driver to see America, and took part in the events of Secret Empire (where he was one of the many heroes tested by the corrupted Captain America's plans). 

After all what is happening to All-Father Thor in his recent journeys I believe he could use the presence of his Brother.",Marvel,1,0.57

Getting into comics,"I have been reading comics for over a year but have mostly stuck to the smaller publishers or DC Vertigo as I find the continuity aspect of Marvel and DC very confusing. However I have recently read Spider-Man life story and I'm about half way through Ultimate Spider-Man which I am enjoying.

I have just realised that Ultimate Spider-Man is not set in the same universe as other comics (other than the ultimate series). Does this matter? Have I picked a bad starting point to get into it?

I have also started watching the original X Men Animated Series and not sure where to start with the comics if i don't have any background on X Men other than the cartoon. Should i go with Ultimate X Men or something else?

Finally, I like the idea of getting into a few Marvel ongoing titles so i have a few floppys to look forward to each month but I think I need more knowledge on the correct universe and what is happening in the comics at the moment to get into it. Are there any runs that have recently started or will start soon that I could easily jump on and enjoy? ",Marvel,1,0.67

Political positions of superheroes ,"Thor is disinterested and doesn’t care about politics. 

Ironman is obviously a George W. Bush republican. 

Captain America is odd. He would’ve supported the old-school government, and would’ve obviously been an FDR New Deal democrat. But a lot of his comics are centered around the fact that the government can’t be trusted, with massive organizations like SHIELD. He’s probably one of those people that believes that politics is too fucked up in the modern day, and misses the era of Roosevelt.

^ He is obviously somebody who would be a social democrat though. 

As far as I can tell, Hawkeye is just a chill guy who doesn’t care. Matt Fraction’s run epitomized him well. He’s the kind of guy that just wants to go home and fall asleep watching TV after a long day, not argue about politics.

Spider-Man is easy, he’d be a Democrat. He’s a kid from NYC, who idolizes people like Captain America.

Reed Richards reminds me of Woodrow Wilson. Somebody who believes that the president should be as powerful as possible.

Punisher wouldn’t really care, but he’d hunt down any corrupt politicians. 

I can’t see any of the X-Men as Republicans…lol

The when the protagonist is like "" I didn't think I was that weak"" the villain compliments his strength and says it's about "" this strong"" and pimp slaps him knocking him out. He and his buddy stand over the unconscious man and reveal had the protagonist not punched him and kept running there was nothing he could do.

"Who do you think are the Half Dozen heroes regularly in Manhattan, in Insomniac?","
Besides Peter and Miles I mean, this comic is set between the first game and Miles’ solo game, so no Wraith or FF yet, and it’s been made quite clear that Peter doesn’t know Dr.Strange either. And both state that despite The Avengers being stationed in New York, they are almost never around to use the tower since they are so busy.

I’m curious to see hear what other people think of this.

Personally I think the other half dozen heroes regularly in Manhattan, he spoke of are Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Moon Knight, and finally Cloak and Dagger.

 I would love, LOVE to say Luke Cage, but there is no way that man tolerates the Underground-Roxxon War going down in Harlem. He would have kicked some ass. Also it’s my headcanon that the X-Men are currently stationed in San Francisco rather than New York.

So I’d love to hear who you think are the Half Dozen.

Movies I did not like: The most recent Thor (badass villain got no screen time and the humor tried too hard). Eternals fell a little flat. Black Widow deserved better. 

The Disney+ shows I liked: WandaVision and Loki (S1) were amazing. Top notch tv and great additions imo. Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier felt rushed and spotty at times, but considering the filming restrictions, I liked it. Moonknight was very cool and so was What If? Oh and the Hawkeye special. 

I did not really care for Ms. Marvel because the story was poorly written and the style was too different for my taste. Not bad, but not great. She-Hulk wasn’t that bad it was whatever. 

I know since then there have been many more to come out but I don’t know where to start or in what order. Based on what I’ve liked and disliked, what can I watch that’s not a waste of time or just cheesy and boring “filler.”
