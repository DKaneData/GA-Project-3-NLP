I was eleven years old, and was pretty confused when I saw that so many of the classic heroes I knew from T.V shows and movies were replaced. But ultimately it introduced me to some of my favorites, like Miles Morales and Kamala Khan.

It was a weird but ultimately a very enjoyable era of Marvel to start with. 

But I would love to hear, what era others started with!

Which version of the Sentry was more fun or shown more promise ?,"https://preview.redd.it/z2jpi4zv1wwc1.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=023753aa4c90f79f1bccd85b6050e2a8153aa601

I'm a Sentry fan, surprise, and I honestly believe both versions had promise if one writer would have bold enough to explore the reality of them way more than the few issues they shown up respectively.

* Death Seed Sentry was basically Sentry without the Void AKA full potential mode. Stable and ""healthy"". Strong enough to hold 50% of the weight of Exitar, the celestial executioner and move it's corpse away from earth.
* Merged Sentry was....we actually don't know as it seemed like he constantly battles with the Void inside when IMO it supposed to be a version where there is no more Sentry or Void or Robert as separate entities. Anyway he was way more OP than ever before (one shotting Carol and Thor, incapaciting She-Hulk).",Marvel,6,0.88

Most Awkward Hug in The History of The Planet,,Marvel,2,1.0
Would you guys accept newsprint if it meant cheaper and bigger comics?,"So I think one thing we all agree on is that sometimes comics can be a bit on the expensive side. Especially if you want to follow an entire line of books like the X-Men. Which makes sense considering the quality of the paper they're printed on. 

But let's ask a hypothetical. If Marvel switched back to newsprint paper, which is relatively cheaper to print, about 48 pages per issue, and price at about $1.99 USD, would you guys be down for it?

I would be. I think each individual issue being twice as big can help with some of the pacing issues some modern comics have. And producing it on cheaper paper would help keep the cost of each issue reasonable. 

Plus, with comics being priced at two dollars an issue, that's 10 comics for just $20. You can't tell me that's not a good deal.

I got other ideas for alternate publishing methods I think Marvel could employ.",Marvel,7,0.82
Who do you think are the current members of the Avengers of Earth-1048?,"I personally think at the moment (as of Spider-Man 2) the current roster is Thor(Jane Foster), Vision, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther (Current chair person), and Wasp.

My headcanon is that Cap‚Äôs off with Falcon looking for Bucky at the moment, Captain Marvel is off with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor is M.I.A after Ragnarok so Jane is currently wielding Mjolnir. 

I‚Äôd love to hear others‚Äô headcanons on this.",Marvel,3,1.0

Thor is way too arrogant for his own good [Defenders #10],,Marvel,8,0.9
What Marvel character needs a live action redo,"I just saw one someone talking about who hasn't been in a live action movie. I have a different question, who needs the redo.

There has been a few characters who have had a bad live action showing. Now I'm a huge Dr Doom fan, and that was bad, but at least he had a pretty good mask.

But Apocalypse... what in the blue blazing hell was that!!! If you were to put that movie on mute, would you even know who the hell that was. EVERYONE ELSE looks relatively comic accurate. They looked different but I new who Archangel was. Nightcrawler is a tricky character to bring to live action but they got it done. Unless you know X Men lore you wouldn't get the pyramid thing. 

So, who do you think needs a redo? ",Marvel,443,0.95

Black Widow: Making her a hero who wants redemption instead of a ruthless, morally grey assassin.

"Eric the Red, aka the Kang Hunter. ","In an alternate timeline Thor Odinson and Wanda Maximoff, aka The Scarlet Witch, were lovers and had a child named Eric Thorson with fiery red hair and a mischievous glint in his eye. 

Shortly after Eric's birth his parents were killed by a version of Kang the Conqueror but the boy was saved by his Uncle Loki. 

Loki with the help of the Enchantress raised Eric with the idea of revenge. How better to take revenge against Kang and his well ordered timeline than to introduce a new god of chaos? 

Learning how to use his vast potential from his Uncle Loki and growing up under the watchful gaze and doting attentions of the Enchantress, Eric grew to usurp Chthon and claim the title god of chaos. 

It was after that victory that Kang fearing him simply weeded that entire timeline out of existence. 

Eric barely managed to escape to the 616 timeline, where he is significantly less powerful but just as hateful towards every version of Kang and any tyrant who would impose a strict order over others. 

Now under the name Eric the Red a new hero has causing disasters for the plans of would be oppressors and sowing the seeds of chaos and freedom to rebuild his power and hunt his prey.

For all Czech/Slovak people watching X-Men '97...,"If you are from Czech Republic or Slovakia or you do understand the language, please consider watching X-Men '97 with czech dubbing.

All her scenes with czech dubbing are just &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;... I totally recommend it &lt;3 ""The name's Gambit, mon ami. Remember it."" is goooood, but ""Jmenuju se Gambit, mon ami. To si pamatuj."" is much better &lt;3 It's really rare to see dubbing being better then original but this is definitely the case. I don't say these words just because I'm Slovak, nope... I watched it first with original up to the Episode 5 (because back then it was most recent) and then I rewatched it again witch czech and even tho I was hooked to original voices, I quickly got used to the dubbing.
