"After a community vote,  post proposals MUST have a tiny writing sample and not just a title","The past week or so, we have had a lot of posts with simply a title proposal. While that does not go against the rules, it seems like an easy way to farm karma and create unneeded controversy.

So we, the mods decided to put it to a community vote as to if proposals should or shouldn't be required to have a writing sample.

The consensus was that proposals should include it.

Moving forward, a proposal post must have a tiny writing sample, or it will be REMOVED. The sample can be as little as a paragraph or as big as you want 

DON'T FREAK OUT!!!


We, the mods understand that some may feel like they're more ""idea"" people and not writers, so this may not seem fair.  

So our recommendation is to simply try and describe where the idea came from or what you think it could look like.. it can be a combination of sentences to try and help us see your proposal idea.

We understand that this may not be very popular, but hopefully, it will cut back on things becoming so controversial. 

As always, remember this is a satire community, and we're here for fun

This comes after a litany of news reports citing various experts that claimed the tents pose a fire risk.

Speaking to the brave student protestors, Bowman exclaimed: ""Those idiots wouldn't know a fire if they saw it with their own eyes!"" The representative from New York went on to laud the efforts of the organizers, while drawing similarities between his own experience and theirs.

""You ever notice that when they want to take you down, they always start yelling 'fire'?

Candidates Agree To Commission For Presidential Debates Hosting Literal Dick Measuring Competition,"Reuters, April 20, 2024: Frustrated at the apparent lack of appetite for a presidential debate between candidates in the 2024 election cycle, the Commission for Presidential Debates instead offered to host a literal dick measuring competition- which has now been endorsed by both campaigns.

A staffer for Biden, who famously fathered the legendary Hunter Biden pocket python told reporters “bring it on!”. 

Meanwhile a spokesman for trump, whose diseased stump was famously described as a “small mushroom” by one of the many, many women he has had to pay in order to have sex with him, and whose legal defense against accusations of rape was that his penis was too small, said “When the commission called I thought they wanted a competition to measure who IS the bigger dick, so of course I said yes. But now it turns out they want to measure who HAS the bigger dick! Am I fired?”

The commission has already sourced volunteers to perform the measurements, with Marjorie Taylor Greene not hesitating to volunteer to measure Biden’s instrument of generation. “Phwoar!” She was heard to exhault “I bet it’s like an orange balanced on top of 24oz can of Coors!”

She added “careful of that puddle on the floor, I think me ’waters broke’, if you know what I mean!”

There was no shortage of volunteers for the Republican candidate, with Lindsey Graham at the front of the line “pick me, pick me!” he was heard to squeal “I want to see if he has any ladybugs too!”

Mr Graham’s task is thought to be made all the harder on account of the entire GOP simultaneously having trumps dick in their mouth. That, and the fecal mater in Trump’s adult diaper.

It’s not clear if the contest will actually go ahead, however, as the former president, and future jail bird, will likely be too busy being prosecuted for lying about paying off one of the many, many women he has had to pay to have sex with him.",babylonbee,51,0.77

4D Chess: Trump Cratering Truth Social Stock to Win Over Liberals Who All Shorted It,"Trump’s promise of an economic windfall for the middle class is finally paying dividends. With the upcoming election where he knows his devout followers will never leave him even if it sends them to jail, literally, he has been trying to make inroads into a liberal voting block that has despised him until very recently. Truth Social, down another 11% Monday, has been in free fall losing more than half its peak value in just over two weeks. Liberals who had shorted the stock or bought puts are seeing a huge increase in their net worth. In other words, Trump is making them rich. While financial experts have questioned bringing a company public when it has almost no revenue, huge operating losses, and a toxic reputation keeping advertisers from coming anywhere near it, it seems like this is another move of political brilliance from a self proclaimed “very stable genius”. With Trump trailing in most polls, could this be the move that finally brings moderates and liberals in his direction?

"Babylon WannaBe: Disney declares it has seceded from Florida, and is now it's own sovereign country.","Disney CEO Bob Iger chose the route many self declare elites have and openly declares himself unbeknownst to any nation.  For centuries, wealthy people have had to deal with backwards countries and their nonsense laws.  When traveling, did you know Turkey will cut your hand off if you steal, while in America it's respectable to run systems of banking, credits and loans to do the same thing?  The wealthy people of the world finally have said they had enough, and won't be kept down any longer, so they formed a resistance group against governments known as the World Economic Forum.  These disenfranchised and underprivileged billionaires finally have banded together to fight for their right to party.  No longer will laws against things like theft, bio terrorism and under aged non-consentual sex hold these guys back.  They're here to party and Epstein Island's closed.  

So welcome to New Disney Land.  It's just like Old Disney Land, except they are not going to pay taxes or be held down by bureaucratic strings of any kind.  It's a paradise for billionaires!  The Cayman Islands are hiding their offshore shell company taxes in New Disney Land now!  So business is booming already.  Not all are pleased with Bob Iger's choice though.

Rob Desantis, mayor of Florida wrote open letters to news papers pleading that he does not have the power to raise an army against another nation. If Disney Land would have simply stopped paying taxes, he could have enforced law and sent the national guard, but due to them being a whole new nation, Rob is powerless unless the President acts.  Joe Biden on hearing of this remarked,""Come at me. And if you think that I'll, then maybe I will. I'll... uh Hey would ya look at these fine men and fine girls.... uh.... Quijobo Amalasarus.""  Presidential interpreters say that Joe meant by saying,""Come at me."" that Disney must first attack the USA soil to provoke a counter offensive.  Joe Biden does not want to be known as attacking a country who's stood for the rights of indigenous people before this country was born as per the documentary Pocahontas.  

New Disney Land stands strong, broad casting their message on Pay Per View Channel known as the Disney Channel.  They boast all the kings horsemen and all the kings men as their army.  Standing strong in the front of the ranks is Tinkerbell, a bunch of Storm Troopers and Darth Vader himself. Those who believe in the power of Disney magic know there's no way to stand against such overwhelming forces.  Hell, most armies have only one drummer boy, but they have Seven Dwarves!  Thoughts and prayers are being put out that New Disney World does not invade the USA ... Though some are already willing to surrender and not resist an invasion so the USA can return to its precolonial roots of a lush rain forest where everyone lived in peace and happiness forever before.",babylonbee,93,0.79

This is all far too extreme and narrow-minded for the 21st century.

Love is love right? Aids isn’t a punishment from God, it’s something to be shared and spread throughout the world, just like love!!

Children should be able to choose their genders by mutilating their genitals and taking hormones, after all parental consent and control is a thing of the past, it’s the 21st century, children need to experience true freedom, life is short, since they can decide their gender they can also decide their age and identify as “mature” and date and have sexual relationships with adults, especially at sex offender clown pornographic material storytelling hour in school or your public library, also at local bars where they can learn to dance and put dollar bills in a fag queen’s waistband.

"Controversy, as Bidens next step in his sinister plan to eliminate Easter is revealed","Biden courted controversy recently by retroactively declaring March 31st trans day of visibility in 2009, all the while knowing the date would eventually overlap with the holy holiday of Easter. Not content with just this sacrilege, it has recently been revealed that Bidens next step in his perfidious plan is for Easter to fall on April 20th in 2025. April 20th (or ""4/20"" as it is called by the devil's worshippers), is an international day of debauchery. Even worse, it's the birthday of famed left-winger Adolf Hitler, also a notable supporter of woke gender ideology.


This coup de grace is expected to fully eliminate a holiday already made fragile by the trans menace. We spoke with local Mary Ann Sue Washington of Ohio to hear the thoughts of one of the victims of this atrocious attack;


""Well there i was, celebrating Easter with the part of my family that still talks to me. Suddenly, from my living room TV that is set to fox news 24/7, I was informed that trans people still exist! All I know is that when I was young, trans people were too scared to exist, and Easter was still a holiday. The wokeness needs to stop, haven't you hurt us enough?""


It is not yet known if there will even be an Easter in 2025, or if waves of smoke from the devil's lettuce will suffocate the last vestiges of good, Christian conservativism in this country. Bidens opposition, the devout Christian Trump, has put out a statement confirming that if he is elected, Easter will not fall on 4/20 in the coming year.",babylonbee,80,0.72

World’s Mad Scientists Demand Same Funding as Those Performing Gain-of-Function Research,"(I wrote and article and I wanted some feedback on it)

The League of Evil Scientists took to the podium to demand equitable funding for research of non-virus weapons of mass destruction. “This is absurd,” said lead scientist Dr. Mervin Atrocious. “My colleagues who happen to specialize in virology get unlimited funding to design viruses to kill as many people as possible, in hopes of better understanding how to combat such viruses in the future. But my plans to construct a mechanical bear army are completely unappreciated. Mark my words: the world will rue the day they ignored the Cyberbear.” After several minutes of maniacal laughter, he added. “Of course, the purpose of my research would be to ensure that the world has effective countermeasures against cybernetically-enhanced bears designed to slaughter everything in their path.

But Dr. Atrocious isn’t the only scientist who feels discriminated against due to focusing on threats besides infectious diseases. Dr. Susan Vylle said “The world has a strong anti-evil bias that makes our work as mad scientists difficult. Even the US government paused their funding for gain-of-function research when people started speculating that the institute that was intentionally designing deadly bat-derived coronaviruses was somehow related to the deadly bat-derived coronavirus that was discovered just outside their lab. Conspiracy theories hurt us all.” Dr. Vylle continued, “But those scientists of non-conventional moralities were able to get their funding back. Meanwhile, not a single government entity was willing to approve my grant to study subliminal rage-inducement in digital spaces. If it weren’t for the private funding I was able to get from social-media companies, I would have been out on the street. Many of my fellow scientists of alternative sanities aren’t so lucky.

Ubertechniker Herman Schiffler expressed similar sentiments. “I came with a plan to design a ray that makes people hate Jews. And yet even my brothers at the Institute for Morally-Dubious Studies rejected my genius. So did the Center for Applied Evil. They said all this Nazi stuff was going overboard. If it weren’t for the applied evil program at Harvard University, I might never have found support.” And yet even then, Dr. Schiffler faced unwarranted skepticism when a series of anti-Jewish protests erupted shortly after he began his work. “There is no proof that my Jew-hatred ray had anything to do with previously peace-loving liberals suddenly demanding the mass slaughter of Jews,” said Dr. Schiffler. “None at all. Yet they paused my funding for a year while they looked into the matter. It’s the height of anti-science thinking.”

The League of Evil Scientists has issued an ultimatum to the world, demanding $7 trillion in funding for their projects or they will detonate an antimatter bomb at earth’s core, blowing up the planet. The deadline is set for whenever their Gofundme page reaches its goal. The world governments have meanwhile issued a statement that they will not give in to this extortion and also they already blew all their funding on a grant to Dr. Horrendous to develop a new strain of Covid that also gives people AIDS.",babylonbee,79,0.93

Several celebrities escaped into the lobby and attempted to bash through the glass doors of the building, but Hansen was too quick for them, leaning in their way and blocking their path. ""Going somewhere?"" he asked. ""I just want to have a talk about the way you're preying on women and other innocent people. Let's sit down and have a little chat.""

Panicked actors climbed to the roof of the building and escaped by way of their waiting private jets and helicopters, though each was horrified to see their pilot turn around and reveal himself to be Chris Hansen.

**Biden Visits Border To Cut Ribbon For Official Border Grand Opening** 

BROWNSVILLE, TX — In a long-awaited move expected to generate some attention, President Joe Biden arrived at the southern U.S. border today to cut the ribbon for its official Grand Opening.

Alongside representatives from the Border Patrol and other government dignitaries, Biden presided over the ceremonial ribbon-cutting to signify that the border between Mexico and Texas was now recognized as fully open for travel.

""Come one, come all,"" Biden said as he snipped the blue ribbon with scissors. ""Listen up, folks. We've put a lot of work into this moment. There were some people who didn't want to wait for the grand opening. That's alright. They're still… they're still… it's ok if they… we're fine. I'm proud to declare the border officially open. Come on in and enjoy the festivities. Ice cream.""

Biden made his visit to the border town of Brownsville, which has seen a steady trickle of border crossers, and insisted that the border had remained closed until this ceremony. ""To say that we've had an open border is a bunch of malarkey,"" he said. ""My opponent is supposedly visiting some place called Eagle Pass today, where they claim tens of thousands of migrants enter the country every month. We know that's false. ‘Eagle Pass' sounds like a made-up town, anyway. Where's Jill? Is this Canada?""

Biden then wandered away from reporters and was last overheard demanding to speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

At publishing time, officials estimated there were approximately 5,369 new migrants who crossed the border during Biden's speech.",babylonbee,433,0.79

Biden Arrives At Border To Address His Voters

BROWNSVILLE, TX — Amid record-breaking illegal immigration at the southern border, President Biden arrived in Brownsville Texas to address his voters, who had crossed into the United States the previous night.

""Welcome, voters, make yourselves at home!"" said Biden to a group of military-aged male Chinese nationals and a crowd of convicted felons from a maximum security Venezuelan prison. ""My nurse Jill always says you people are unique breakfast tacos and I couldn't have said it better. We're excited for you to live here. You have plenty of great states to choose from, like Ohio, Pennsylvania, or any other crucial battleground states. I was... I... I..."" ""... well, anyway.""

The confused migrant crowd was then directed to a welcome station to receive their smartphones, visa gift cards, and mail-in ballots. ...

Nation with fewer churchgoers than ever before is dangerously close to a theocracy,"New reports suggest that the United States, which has seen a steady decline in church membership for at least 8 decades in a row, is dangerously close to embracing Christian nationalism. The repeal of Roe v Wade, which established a woman's right to abortion back when church membership was at 73%, has been seen by many of a harbinger of an impending theocracy.

PHILADELPHIA, PA — Former comedy legend and prolific rapist Bill Cosby announced outside his home this week that he has officially joined the terrorist group Hamas in an apparent attempt to convince progressive feminists to stop criticizing his raping behavior.

""Those Hamas people... they rape, and they rape all the day long and the left-wing feminists still love them,"" said Cosby to reporters. ""So now, I am a 'Hamas.' As-salamu alaykum. Please do not criticize my raping, which is a legitimate act of decolonization and resistance. Allahu Akbar. Thank you.""

Cosby's former critics were quick to backtrack their criticism of his sexual predation upon hearing the news.
