Black Adam‚Äôs Egyptian Gods Personalities,"I‚Äôve tagged it as a Spoiler as I‚Äôm mentioning the ongoing Shazam Vol 5. In this run, Zeus and the other gods that make up Shazam‚Äôs powers influence him with their personalities, with Atlas making him arrogant, Hercules making him reckless, Zeus making him horny and Mercury making him act like a prankster I guess and Solomon just making him super wise.

Im curious about if Black Adam‚Äôs Gods began to try to assert more control over him how would they affect his personality? 

I dont know much about Egyptian mythology so after a quick google I‚Äôve only found out that Shu is a cooling calm influence as god of the air, and that they‚Äôre all benevolent. Does anybody have any guesses or info on how it might affect Black Adam‚Äôs personality.

The Gods are

Shu
Heru (Horus)
Amon
Zehuti
Aton

Is there an order in which to read the comics?,"Hey!! So I'm sort of new to DC comics and I've received a few as birthday/Christmas gifts and there are some in my school library.

Raven and Kid Flash after The terror of Trigon New Teen Titans arc,"I just finished reading from the start of The new teen titans all the way through the Terror of Trigon(New Teen Titans volume 2 issue 5) and have a few questions as this was where I planned to jump off the series and back to my Batfamily post-crisis reading.

I was hoping there would be an epilogue in the following issue but the storyline is moving back to Lilliths origins so I have a couple of questions that can hopefully help me tie a few loose ends.

For Raven is there a specific issue where she returns to the team. I was just hoping to get some closure on her arc but it ends abruptly with her disappearing.

For Wally is there an issue in teen titans or the flash where he gets his powers back and they are no longer killing him?

I was mainly reading for the Robin to Nightwing arc for Dick Grayson but got invested and decided to at least continue until The hive, Slade and Trigon were completed. I feel I was able to do that outside of those two points for Raven and Wally.",DCcomics,2,0.6

Additional Robin ,"My kind of sad idea, regarding Nightwing and Red Hood. We all know that first kid of Bruce was Dick, he was very young and all. Once he was enrolled into the private school after Bruce adopted him, he was kind of bullied but didn't told it either to Bruce or Alfred, because he was still recovering from loss of his parents, but there was one kid who was always protecting him from bullies in school. Later Dick came to the information that his saviour from the bullies was also an orphan (kid of teenage couple who decided to let go of him), but since he was very talented in science he did revived a scholarship to the prestige school (the one that Dick was in). And since he was few years older than him he was kind of big brother figure for Dick. It didn't took long for Dick to invite his brother figure (let's name him Michael)to the mansion, since he was only one who was nice to him. It didn't took Alfred more than a second to see what was Dick planning, which is convincing Bruce to adopt Michael. I took some time but with combined Dicks and Alfred convincing him, he did it. Michael was teenager at the time he was adopted by Bruce and was in heaven, first because someone did adopted him at least, second he really did liked Dick, and last well living in Wayne mansion can't be that bad for a teenager. Of course after sometime he did figured out about Batman and Robin. One night when Batman and Robin where on a patrol he just figured out the combination on the piano and walk right into the batcave. Of course Bruce wasn't very happy with that, but decided to give him a chance. Bruce did few simulations on Michael and he was shocked how good he was. It didn't took much time until Michael could go with Batman on the patrols. Of course there was an issue with two Robins at one time but they quickly figured it out by giving Michael his own superhero name The Knight, Michael choose it by himself, of course Lucius created new suit for him. Micheal was more that happy to help Batman, and since he was his own superhero he did tried to go by himself, failed few times but was successful most of it. There were of course ups and downs in the story, but Michael never did turned his back on Dick, always was big brother to him. When came the time came when Dick changed from Robin to Nightwing, everyone understud Dicks motives. Not long after Nightwing moved to Bludhaven, The Knight was working on the huge case of human trafficking, he did asked Bruce if he can go on his own to the South America to end it, Bruce wasn't against it, he was even happy that Michael wanted to do something by himself and he did trusted him to bring the organisation to the justice. After few months of being in South America Michael returned to Gotham successful. Then he noticed that there is yet another Robin. He wasn't happy with that idea because he knew exactly what is the price of it, and he did told it to Bruce, there was a huge fight between them about it, but then Michael saw Jason, and he turned from anger to compassion. Michael and Jason really quickly liked eachother, Michael did a lot of training with Jason, and he did appreciate it, it came to the point where Bruce let Michael take Jason on patrol by themselves. Michael was really great big brother figure for Jason but he didn't forget about Dick. There were time that only three of them went for a patrol, Alfred of course had to convince Bruce for the whole day to allow that, but there were ""only brothers patrols"". Of course we know how it goes with Jason. In this he's killed at the time when Dick and Michael fight the crime ring in Bludhaven together, of course they hear the news form Gotham that Robin was killed by The Joker. Micheal was so angry at that that he took off and went straight for The Joker, he did had Joker on his knees laughing, Michael wanted and almost took the last swing at joker but was stopped by Batman, Micheal and Bruce looked into eachother eyes and Bruce knew he lost one more son today. Their relationship was never the same, Michael almost never visited Wayne mansion, and when he did was only speaking with Alfred. Of course after sometime there was a Red Hood incident in Gotham. Not long after they did figured out that Red Hood is resurrected Jason, and when there was a fight between Red Hood and Joker, Michael did interviewed, kicking Red Hood aside but leaving himself vulnerable to Joker, Michael took off his mask, looked at Jason, said ""I'm sorry kid"", and smiled very warmly before Joker shoot him in the head. 
After that Bruce did had enough of Jokers, and everyone did assumed he was going to kill him, but now it was Jason who stopped him, telling him that Michael wouldn't want that.
The Justice League don't know about Michael (The Knight) because Bruce doesn't like to talk about that. Jason did became darker and more distance from everyone. And Dick, he like always hide his pain behind humour.
They never brought Michael again apart from his birthday, then Bruce, Dick, Jason and Alfred just sat together and told a stories of creative pranks he pulled on them.",DCcomics,0,0.31
Who are the top ten richest people on the current Earth?,"I was wondering who the richest people in the current DC continuity are, on Earth. There are a number of Company Owners like Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne, but do any others compare to the likes of LexCorp and Wayne Industries?

I imagine if anyone would be close it would be Stagg Industries, currently belonging to both Sapphire and Sebastian Stagg. But do they even compare? Theres also Ted Kord, Oliver Queen, Maxwell Lord and Michael Holt with Terrifitech etc. Do any of these go anywhere near Bruce and Lex levels?

Vandal Savage, and Ra‚Äôs Al Ghul may have immense levels of wealth from being alive for so long. Both probably either similar or greater to Lex and Bruce.

Aquaman and Black Adam could make the list both owning their own countries, however I‚Äôm not sure how wealthy Khandaq is.

Who do you guys think the top ten are?

clones of Roy Harper. (questions regarding them),"Im on season 3 of Young Justice, and there are currently two clones of Roy Harper, if im counting right. the first Roy Harper, the original that was abducted right after becoming Speedy and kept inside of a tube, the second Roy Harper-the main one that we see through out Young Justice, the first clone, and the third one, some.. random Cop? maybe it was late at night or something but i did not get how there were 3 roys in one place, when did the third Roy come into play? thats my first question. the second being, is this whole Roy clone thing canon to the comics? does it play a big role? do all the roys have different lives? do they interact at all? are all Roys parental figures to Lian? And i think my most important question to which i couldnt find the answer to anywhere for some reason- which Roy is the Roy we see in ""Redhood and the outlaws"" ? some of these questions might be dumb, but i hope someone will answer them, because i am real lost, and am considering reading some of Speedy's comics, but wanted to get a good idea of what if happening with all the clones before i jump in",DCcomics,2,0.59
