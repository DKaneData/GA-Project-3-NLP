"Babylon WannaBe-&gt;Babylon Bee Fan Fiction: Billionaires losing sleep, worried humans will be happier after they destroy civilization.","Billionaires losing sleep, worried humans will be happier after they destroy civilization.

""What if, after removing all law, there is no paper work, no lawyers, no bureaucracy, no one telling you to file for car insurance, car emissions, car inspection, car registration, gas taxes, taxes of any kind....  What if this makes people happier?""

Billionaires for a Worse Tomorrow wish building tomorrow was as simple as just destroying anything in their way, but it's not that easy.

What if say we take away their smart phones by making up some excuse of network outages and viruses... Then what? Imagine what might happen if they don't have phones... They might talk to other human beings!  That could be disastrous.  

What if we take away their fast food selections by strict regulations of health... Then people will be healthier!  There's no easy win, no free lunch when it comes to making people unhappy.

Though we have billions of dollars and a desire to ruin all other people's lives so the hot women will look up to us like princes in a Hallmark special, it's just not as easy as you'd think to ruin all of civilization.  Hey, maybe another round of bio terrorism or two might do the trick.",babylonbee,12,0.85
