Majority of Americans support being replaced by anyone who can walk across the border,"So the consensus is nobody wants to work, and everyone walking into the country provides far more value, far more hard working, far more intelligent and productive members of society.

We keep things a little too clean in America, we need more trash in the street, more parking on the sidewalk, more loud music at night, crudely built housing and commercials in different languages.

See, the American culture is just too good, that’s racist and needs to be replaced with one more comfortable with crime, migrants shouldn’t fear deportation for being nuisances, causing problems and committing crime, they should be celebrated for the “diversity” they bring because otherwise things are just too white, and that’s perpetuating White supremacy, the less white people the better, like Joe Biden says, we need an unrelenting stream of non-Whites so that Whites become a minority in America, and if you have a problem with that, YOU’RE A RACIST NAZI WHITE SUPREMIST MAGA TRUMP SUPPORTING TERRORIST!!!!",babylonbee,210,0.75

Babylon Wannabe: Budlight in lawsuit when some drunk rednecks buy Bud Light and throw the cans around the bar hitting patrons.,"Bud light is in hot water, so basically just a warmed version of itself when some rednecks got drunk.

Two Toes Jones lost his first game of pool hustling as a rogue beer can crashed into the eightball, sinking it to the corner pocket.  But fortunately for Two Toes, his opponent, a local from the college campus got straight drilled in the side of the head and knocked unconscious so Two Toes didn't have to pay the wager.
