What’s the worst change from the comics that the MCU made to these Avengers? Day 4: Hawkeye,"Captain America (Steve Rogers): Not showing more of him fighting Nazis in WW2 with the Invaders team.

Iron Man: Mishandling his rogue's gallery, more specifically never showing his rivalry with the Mandarin.

Black Widow: Making her a hero who wants
redemption instead of a ruthless, morally grey assassin.

Two Apocalypses?,"Something that’s been bothering me for years, but the show has always featured two Apocalypse’s. Throughout the series Cable travels through time to battle both of them for different reasons. 

In Time Fugitives we see actions in the past influence future Cable’s timeline (I’ve always theorized Apocalypse had a master plan to guarantee his succession in 3999) . Whereas in Beyond Good and Evil we see future Apocalypse travel to the Axis of Time and use Magneto/Sinister to kidnap Psychics in the present day, all the while avoiding his present day self who is still supposed to be in space with Deathbird (as per the ending of Sanctuary part 2). 

We also see future Apocalypse return to the present time in the episode The Fifth Horseman when he uses Fabian Cortez as an avatar/sacrifice. Wouldn’t there now be two Apocalypses in the present day? Help me make sense of this? ",Marvel,37,0.91

Is Marvel Unlimited disorganized on purpose???,"EDIT:  a huge THANK YOU to everyone who helped me with the baby steps to figuring this out.  I was playing with the browser and typed the comics/series, and it took me to a simple alphabetical list of series, which then had the issues albeit with the first issues at the very end. The site can use instructions for people like me, who don’t have people who can teach them in real life. There’s lots out there, and comics are for everyone.

Anyway:  this subreddit is awesome!!! Thanks again from the bottom of my klutz-at-technology heart!!!


(Original post)

I have been trying to read the comics on marvel unlimited since getting the subscription last week, but somehow every day it gets harder to find ANY comics when I search for them. This includes comics I started reading the day before and wanted to finish.

I have been trying to search for Excalibur 1988 #1, to finish reading it, but it’s gone.  I can find the current series 2019, which gives me individual issues for pages instead of just showing me a list of issues; but then the search starts giving me wolverine issues. Worse, it floods the search with articles, videos, etc, instead of just giving me the comics.

I got this subscription so I can catch up on the comics from the start, the whole story, and follow along with various x-men podcasts like a good little nerd; but instead of being a normal database of comics - like a library, if you will - it’s as if it’s designed by someone who HATES having to share the information.

If people are paying for a service you’re offering, access to your content, once we’re in you need to let us read the content. It’s fine, you already have the money, and if you want more you need to let the content work its magic. It’s digital content, so reading it won’t leave grubby finger marks on the digital pages.

Marvel: please make it easier to find the issues so I can read them. Whatever is going on in your current design is just making me resentful and want to quit. “Rage quit” is not going to lead to me buying anything later. I want to be so invested in the content I end up buying replica magneto helmets and nightcrawler socks and other stuff, but I can’t get there if the bad website design stays this bad and I give up in frustration instead of engaging in commerce with your business.",Marvel,9,0.67

Question on multiple ongoing books,"So I was born 89' and started reading comics around 8 and got into late 80s early 90s. And my teen years I found these 99' comics never really read them in order or anything it's just the spiderman I REMEMBER like vividly going to the store and seeing.

So I finally read them both again in order. And it's not exactly read the amazing spiderman them Peter parker:spiderman...but it kinda was I'd do 2 issues of asm then over to Peter parker...it was really cool to see oh this is THE SAME MONTH. Or it felt like Peter Parker story took place after the amazing. It was more filler issues, about his life as Peter more than spiderman....

Is there anything similar with other characters where 2 books ran at the same time for like 40-60 issues. And one dealt with like the main story and one dealt with the B story ? ..I feel empty now it's done.",Marvel,0,0.33

Are there any comics that taught you genuine life lessons?,"I had a moment recently where I was just casually reading one of the Spider-Man comics from like 2018, and there was a scene that spoke really loudly to me, I'd been struggling with a lot of things and the way that various parts of this scene were worded genuinely helped me answer a couple things for myself in that moment.

Thor underwater,"Can Thor use his powers in water, or underwater? Can he control water? I know he can probably make Thunder storms and make it rain… would he be effective in water?

Water is a better conductor than air and on land, so shouldn’t his lighting perform better on wet things or in water?

I know the main issue would be his inability to breathe underwater, but he’s a god so he can probably find a way around that too lol.

I’m speaking of comics Thor of course. In the comics he can create portals, teleport mountains, etc. he’s so much cooler in the comics. I’m just curious as to the full extent of his powers. I love him and beta ray bill (my fav)!
