What are your top three Iron Man Armors?,"

The armored adventurer has had many suits over the years, so what are your top picks. From functionality, to power, to looks. Anything (from main 616 continuity) is up for pickings.

1. Endo Sym Armor (always will be, because it's so freaking awesome, from its power to, the way it connects to Tony's body such as a symbiote.)

2. Model Prime Armor (because it was the armor Tony was wearing when I first got into comics, and its adaptability is sick as hell.)

3. Silver Centurion (The first SERIOUS alteration to the Iron Man suits)

Deadpool 3 is a love letter to Gen X and Late Millennials... and DOOM!,"I did post this in a comic threat. So sorry if this is a double post. 

After watching all the Deadpool and Wolverine movies trailers I have come to one conclusion. This is the last run of Fox Marvel, and a love letter to us old marvel movie fans. Obviously the younger millennials and gen z grew up with the movies but us old men/women lived through it. I still remember my friends and me at the midnight showing of the original X Men movie. I have all sorts of memories like that. And I can only assume Ryan Reynolds was the same way.

From just being in it for a second or actually having real screen time... they are getting the band back together again! From Ang Lee Hulk (I think) and Elektra and New Mutants to more money makers like the X Men, they are all showing up. There is just one movie that hasn't shown up in the trailer... and it could be the entrance of DOCTOR DOOM.

Nowhere in the previews have I seen any reference of the two Fantastic Four movies. Now this could be because of the Fantastic Four marvel movie coming up, but it doesn't stop them from using others. If there is one villain who would use hero's jumping into alternate time lines to the main marvel universe, it would be Doom. And this wouldn't be the first time Doctor Doom would have pulled this off. From Secret Wars to Onslaught, the mad lad had done it before.

So yes, this is my latest how Dr Doom will show up in the MCU. Either way, Deadpool 3 is going to be pure awesomeness.",Marvel,0,0.36

Which Marvel villains don't make sense as characters?,"Which Marvel villains don't make sense as characters? I am not talking about the science behind guys like Sandman, Electro, or Klaw not making sense, Marvel comic books are not science textbooks, those are acceptable creative liberties.

I am talking about villains who don't make sense as characters. I am not talking about a character with a simple motivation, if your actions fit your motive, it's fine. Bullseye likes to kill people and get paid for it, he could make money legitimately elsewhere, but his love of violence prevents him from doing so, and that's fine.

So I am going to pick on two Fantastic Four villains, Trapster and Wizard. Trapster's motive is supposed to be greed, but why didn't he just patent his glue and market it, he could have made millions legitimately, but didn't, for no good reason. Trapster has nearly died several times, gets punched out by superheroes constantly, and has been subjected to Ghost Rider's penance stare and he is still a supervillain, why? The writers also can't decide whether he is a real serious supervillain or a comic relief character, pick one lane and go with it. Either have Trapster quit, up his game by a lot, and pick on a street-level character instead of a team that fights gods for a living or have him be a purely comic relief character. There is a prose novel short story from the 90s where Trapster tries to reform, that is more interesting character work than anything that has been done with him in the comics, but it's not canon.

&amp;#x200B;

Wizard is worse on this score, he has even less reason to be a public supervillain, if he wasn't a public supervillain with a record he would be a dangerous force in the business world. Instead, he is a third-rate supervillain. He is jealous of the FF's fame and Reed Richard's abilities, but did he think becoming a public supervillain would make him more beloved than the FF? He is supposed to be smart, but he makes the same stupid mistakes over and over again, he always tries to defeat the FF with a Frightful Four instead of trying to overwhelm them with a Frightful Fourteen, he and the Frightful do not seem remotely in the Fantastic Four's league. He's too evil to be sympathetic and not evil enough to actually be sinister or menacing. He is similar to the type of villains kid shows have been parodying for the last 20 years.

Guys need opinions on a decision related to comics ,"So as I have mentioned before I'm a old comics fan I have read both marvel and DC even some image and valiant. I used to read comics a lot during my teenage years, years ago but I stopped and been reading only manga for a while but lately I have been getting the feeling to return to comics which I kinda did since last week I have been reading Superman and action comics 90s since I didn't get to read them years ago I've only read Superman 2000s, new 52 and rebirth . 

And I still enjoy comics so I'm confused whether to fully return to comics or stay sticking only to manga like I have been since years now since doing both will overwhelming I still got a lot manga on my reading list I plan to read if I add also comics I'll be overwhelmed especially for DC . As for marvel I have already read nearly every marvel character their 90s, 2000s, 2010s comics I only got newerer current marvel comics to read . DC I have read a lot of it too in the past but not everything there's still some older DC titles I didn't read besides the newer current titles .

And yes I have read more Marvel than DC during my teenage years. So if anyone wants to give their opinion what to choose whether manga or comics ? ",Marvel,0,0.4
