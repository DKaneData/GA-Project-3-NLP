"Nike changes slogan to,""Just riot!"" -A Babylon Wannabee -NotNotTheBee","After riding on the curtails of popularity for causing the race riots through proxy of Colin Kaepernick, Nike has decided to change it's slogan from,""Just do it.""  CEO of Nike: Xi Jipang expresses the reasoning,""Americans love destroying their own country. From fireworks, alcohol and throwing things in fires  or a combination of all three, Americans love destroying their own country.  It came as no surprise, the wild appeal of bringing racism back and race riots.  Americans love destroying their own country, and we just reminded them how fun it is to riot.   Since Americans are dumb, they thank us for helping them remember the ways of hate and destruction, the unbeatable high.  So Nike is proud to embrace it's newfound glory and change it's slogan to'Just Riot!!!' ""
