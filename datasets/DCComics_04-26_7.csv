Help finding a comic book,"Hi everyone!  


I'm trying to remember a comic I read as a kid and need a little help identifying it. Here are the details I remember:  


* The comic focuses on THE ATOM. 
* I remember a scene where this superhero tries to save someone who is being hanged by cutting a rope. 
* Batman and Wonder Woman are involved in a subplot where they are trying to interrogate a criminal. 
* The criminal mentions something about a sailor's knot in relation to the crime they are investigating. 
* There is also a connection to Louis Lane at the end of the comic. 

If anyone has any idea which comic it might be or where I could find more information on it, I would greatly appreciate it!

Who would you approach to train you if you were a normal human like Bruce?,"I've recently read Batman: The Knight and really enjoyed it. It had me wondering, if in the current continuity, someone else decided to follow in Bruce and Anton's footsteps, who would they approach to train them? 

With all of the Heroes and Villains running rampant, they would be spoilt for choice, as long as they can convince them to train them that is.

I doubt the League of Assasins just takes in anyone, so you would have to get someone else to train you first. The Ashram that trained Connor Hawke seems to be a good bet considering they took in a child. Also, Master Kirigi assuming he's taking on new students after the rest of his got slaughtered. Maybe once someone's got that level of training, Deathstroke might consider taking them as an apprentice, after all, he seemed to have a fixation on Robin joining him. However, I don't know if that's solely because of his connection to Batman.

[Discussion] Justice League: Doom ruins the nuance of it's source material (Spoiler for both the Movie and Comic),"Warning: Really Long Post

The 2012 animated movie Justice League: Doom is an adaptation of Mark Waid's miniseries JLA: Tower of Babel, and the most iconic part of that story is the reveal that Batman has a contingency plan for taking down the league if they were to ever go rouge, which has become a staple for online 'who would win' Battleboard discussions. But despite the 2012 adaptation being an alright flick, the one thing it does wrong is the discussion on whether what batman did was right or wrong. I make this post because I just recently read the comic and  while it's not perfect, I felt the comic had a better more nuance take on the contingency plan than the movie.

In the comic book, every character has their own reason for deciding whether or not Batman stays on the team. Martian Manhunter had his own files on earths superheroes in case he ever found himself needing to defend himself and 'defend' is the key word since he was all alone on the planet and had no idea who he can trust, offense was never something he intended, and even then he still regrets making those plans and being so distrustful. Because of all that he decided Batman should stay because even if he finds what Batman did as bad, he feels he would be a hypocrite if he voted to kick him out. The Flash (Wally West in the comic) voted on Batman staying because he felt that while he's furious at Bruce, he's seen the incident where villains swapped bodies with members of the justice league, hell he's seen the reverse flash and the damage that he's capable of , after all the yellow prick killed his aunt, so he felt Batman had a point in being prepared for the worst. The same went for Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner) He literally has the last ring in existence because Hal Jordan went crazy killed all the other lanterns and became a villain, yeah he didn't like batman for what he did, but he is 100% willing to see where he comes from he even understood not telling them. We never saw how Superman voted but It's implied that he voted for Batman to stay. Superman totally gets it.

On the other hand you have Aquaman who believes that they've all earned the trust of the world and at the very least should have trust for each other thus voting against Batman. There's also Plastic Man who was still bitter about nearly being shattered into a million pieces and possibly dying which caused him to vote against Batman even if Batman was the only reason he was on the League but hey, that's what trauma can do to you. Lastly was Wonder Woman who completely believed that Batman didn't intend to abuse these plan nor let them get out, but she couldn't work on a team with someone that she and everyone else knows is actively analyzing all of their weaknesses to disable them even during casual conversation. Knowing that his presence would weaken the league instead of strengthening them, she sadly voted him out. As for Bruce? He left before the voting could even end knowing that him being on the team was going to be a hindrance and that he should have been more trusting of his team.

With all of that in mind, how did the film handle this part? By making every league member as one dimensional and as stupid as they could get away with. Every single member with the exception of Superman was simply too stupid to comprehend why these plans would and should exist and were mad at the existence of such plans, not the breach of trust. Not only that but instead of Batman waiting outside for his fate to be decided by the league before leaving shamefully as to not get in their way later down the line, now he was part of the conversation completely unrepentant and literally calls them all idiots, which in fairness they are but only because the film goes out of it's to make them all so, before leaving the league because apparently they weren't good enough for him.

It basically started the idea that the league is mad about the plans when that was quite literally never the issue and goes out of its way to paint any league member with powers as a short sided idiot for the sake of justifying the plans, loosing all the complex debate from the comics. There other issues I do have with both mediums like the flaws in the plans themselves and how Batman was careless enough to have be stolen, TWICE, but for now I'll can just dismiss as comic book logic so the story could work.",DCcomics,52,0.82

[Discussion] Anybody else tired of Donna troy’s disastrous love life?,"Art: By george perez

Let’s get this out the way writers genuinely need to stop shipping her with characters until she gets some good stories and more character foundation outside of the titans. 

But anyways it’s a shame most of her stories revolve around her love life ( and getting erased from existence and getting her entire life retconned to an annoying degree) and how her relationships kinda just suck.

First we have Terry Long who of course is a marv wolfmans self insert (Yuck) who is also her 30 something college professor that started dating her when she was a 18 year old freshman. (double yuck). Now this would’ve been a lot less weird if they just didnt have him act like a total creep half the time. Like referring to the titans as kids (same age as donna btw) while simultaneously flirting with all the girls in the team. And of course they got married had a kid together and divorced because Terry started to feel insecure and started blaming all of his life’s problems on Donna being a hero. Now the whole being a divorced mom juggling being a superhero would’ve been an interesting for Donna if terry and their kid didn’t get fucking annihilated.

Then we got Roy and there relationship is very…eh…in my opinion I know it gets a lot of praise because of Donna being a mother figure to Lian and them having a lot of history from dating and being on the same team when they were teenagers. But honestly I think most of the praise is just from him not being terry. My main problem with Roy and Donna’s relationship is how they never had a moment that didn’t involve baby mamma drama, Divorce,Dead/crazy ex lovers or Donna being brought from the dead and having an extensional crisis. 

Like there was barely any genuine moments where their shitty lives weren’t constantly brought up and at best they were just fuck buddies. First because of Donna’s divorce and then they were kinda sorting dating/fuck buddies again when she was brought back from the dead but this time Roy was catching feelings but Donna thought he was a total fucking loser (she told him this to his face btw) and wanted to see if she had free will via dating him because she was brought back from wally’s memories of her being perfect. And when she broke things off she didn’t really give a shit about Roy’s feelings she was only afraid of Lian becoming too attached to her.

Another problem is just Roy just constantly being a man whore like there were some old titans silver age panels were teenage Roy would hit on chicks in front of Donna during their dates and one panel where it was implied they broke up because he hit on her roommate. Which I wouldn’t put past him in those days. And then the whole fuck buddies arc thing where Roy was constantly fucking anything with a pulse (tried to fuck a mermaid while his daughter was there btw) and Donna was just kinda having a dry spell I guess.

 I think it would’ve cute if Roy had an arc were he decides to stop being a player and tries to go steady with Donna. With him feeling out of his element because for once he isn’t just focused on getting laid. They could’ve had cute dates where they go to chuck e. cheese with Lian or something along those lines but instead we just got them shooting a bow together…which was ok I guess…",DCcomics,39,0.76

Why can't WB/DC give other villains the Joker Treatment on the Big Screen?,"I'm writing this after watching the new Joker 2 trailer for the 5th time and seeing how much excitement that little teaser has garnered, amongst nerds and non hardcore fans alike. By delving into the backgrounds and motivations of iconic villains like Mr. Freeze, Lex Luthor, or Death strike, Death shot, Hugo Strange, Victor Szasz and many other lesser known villains, WB/DC stand the chance to win new audiences, as these movies explore the humanity and the motivations that drove these characters into villainy. A rarely explore theme in the Comic book movie genre.

These films offer a fresh perspective, allowing viewers to empathize with characters traditionally portrayed as antagonists. Moreover, it opens up storytelling opportunities for unique narratives and anti-hero arcs. Following the MCU fatigue, people are looking for depth and nuance in the movies they choose to support

The success of villain-centric movies(as proven by the reception to the Joker movies) have the potential to diversify the studio's revenue streams, reducing dependence on traditional hero-centric narratives. Additionally, merchandise sales, streaming rights, and potential spin-offs could further boost profits, creating a lucrative new avenue for revenue generation for DC. DCEU might have lost the war for the heroes, but we could definitely win it for the villains.

Addendum: We've had blockbuster trilogies from less known comic characters like Guardians of the Galaxy, Venom and Ant-man. So being lesser known is obviously no longer a good reason for WB to fail once again at capitalising on these great opportunities.

**Before creation**

- Before Creation, it was said that there was only a Great Darkness; a single black infinitude where nothing and everything were the same thing. From the darkness came a burning light. As the light grew, everything was no longer nothing and the darkness screamed, causing an imperceptible flaw in what was once the immaculate perfection of the light. With the birth of the Source from the dark, forces danced with each other like threads on destiny's loom, giving birth to the Lords of Chaos and the Lords of Order.

- The Source of All Things created the Hands to populate the Void with Multiverses using Anti-Crisis Energy. After creating their Multiverse, each Hand would return their energies to the Source. However, one rogue, named Perpetua, refused her fate and desired a vicious reality of eternal crisis and rebirth.

- God (aka YHWH/“The Presence”/ The Voice/ The Hand/ The Source) creates a companion for himself. After a dispute, that companion is cast down to the realm that will later be Hell, becoming known as “The First of the Fallen.” God replaces him by creating the angelic host.

**Dawn of Time (20 billion BCE)**

- Some time before Perpetua created the first Multiverse, the Great Darkness spawned a ""daughter"" in the Void and entrusted her to ""the Shadows"" of a subsection of the Void called The Dark Garden.

- The Source, from which sprung forth an explosion of incalculable energies that heralded the Dawn of Time. Manipulating this newborn multiverse was Perpetua, who entrusted its three realms of matter, anti-matter and dark matter to her sons. As the cosmos slowly expanded and gave rise to stars and planets.

- Destiny, first of The Endless is born and recorded all that transpired in his book.

- Hecate born inside other plane which will become Sphere of gods

**18 Billion Years ago**

- The original GodWorld forms also known as Asgard or Urgrund. (Inside plane which will become Sphere of gods)

**17 Billion Years ago**

- Other Life appears on the GodWorld (the “Second World”).

- Death and Dream of the Endless born

**15 Billion Years ago**

- Perpetua called upon Mar Novu to show him her greatest creation. Perpetua had searched the endless worlds of the Multiverse looking for the perfect creation, but could not find it. Disappointed in what saw, Perpetua bound the Martians with the Humans, creating the Apex Predators; perfect killing machines that would live and fight until the end of time. Upon seeing what his mother had created, Mar Novu told her that he found a cosmic judgement coming for them because of her actions and that she was well aware of that and wished to fight back. Perpetua then tried to share her point of view in vain, leading her to order her Apexes to attack Novu, forcing him to flee.

- Humanoid lifeforms on Urgrund attained godhood, thus becoming the Old Gods. First among the Old Gods was Olgrun.

**13.8** **Billion Years ago**

- Mar Novu told his brothers what he had seen and they agreed that her kinds, the Hands needed to be alerted of her doings. They were interrupted by Perpetua who witnessed their betrayals and sent her Apex Predators to attack her sons.

- The Hands's response was to send the Cosmic Raptor to stop Perpetua's plan. Unable to defeat the Cosmic Raptor, Perpetua, her Apex Predators and the totality of her power were taken to the Source Wall and imprisoned in it. The Hands recreated Perpetua's Multiverse, allowing the Multiverse to evolve without intrusion. Perpetua was trapped and forced to watch it all.

- Imperiex-Prime is created to repeatedly destroyed the universe to create a new one from the ashes of the old.

- After the recreation of the Multiverse, the story of Perpetua was hidden by Krona and the other Maltusians who gathered all evidence.

- A race of beings called Aurakles emerge from the Source at the beginning of creation. In time the race spawns one individual who is fascinated by the lives of organic beings. A sentimental Aurakle witness the death of Violet Harper and unwittingly reaches out to her. It is then forever trapped in her body.

- Rallying a third of the Angels to his side, Lucifer the Morningstar began a War in Heaven against his brother, the Archangel Michael, who defeated Lucifer's forces and cast them down into Hell, where they were reborn as demons. One of the fallen angels begged forgiveness and was transformed by Michael into the Wrath of God, the instrument of divine vengeance. Another angel, who refused to fight for either side, was cast out by Heaven and Hell, condemned to walk Earth alone for the rest of eternity, a stranger to all.

- Destruction of The Endless is born; his sword is created. Delight, last of the Endless, follows after him.

- On Cilia, the Lords of Order manifest themselves as the first sentient race in the universe, a race of energy beings. Presumably, the Lords of Chaos follow suit.

**10 Billion years ago**

- Humanoid life appears on planet Maltus. Maltusian myth tells of a Triarch born then: Tzodar the Destroyer, Quarra the Cultivator, &amp; Archor the Grower. They turn on their father, the great god Daalon, then abandon Maltus, scattering to far corners of universe, one day returning to level Maltus &amp; any who live on it. (The Triarch did not really exist at this time.) Legends of Triarch will inspire a Controller to create his own Triarch millions of years later

- A non-organic race called the Kregors create functioning brains from biological material. They use the brains as power sources.

- Volthoom discovered the Maltusian species on the planet Maltus. These Maltusians were an incredibly intelligent species who sought to learn the secrets of the spectrum. The Maltusians planned to pour all of their emotions into a new battery they called the Great Heart, as they believed losing their emotions would lead to greater discoveries. Upon successfully completing the ritual, a power ring emerged from the center of the Great Heart. Volthoom slipped this ring on and became the First Lantern in the Multiverse.

- Krona, a Maltusan, built a machine to discover the secrets of the very creation of the Universe. He watched through his portal a gigantic palm with a broth of stars in his hand as the machine exploded.

- Driven by guilt over Krona's actions the Maltusans created Manhunters which they then replaced with the Green Lantern Corps. However, due to differences on how to deal with the evil created by Krona the Maltusans split into the Guardians of the Universe and Controllers.

- he spectrum began to affect the mental health of Volthoom, ultimately leading to his insanity and an attempt to kill the Maltusians.

- In order to secure their inventions, the Maltusians destroyed his Travel Lantern, thus trapping Volthoom in the Prime Earth universe. After killing thousands of Maltusians as a form of revenge, Volthoom was defeated by the seven ""Proto-Green Lanterns"", the Great Heart ripped from his chest, and the first Power Ring taken away. Soon after, the Guardians imprisoned Volthoom in an unbreakable chamber (known as the Chamber of Shadows), and wrote him out of their history. A number of Maltusians (now named 'Guardians') remained behind to ensure that the First Lantern was kept imprisoned and became known as The Hidden Ones.

- Olgrun fell to madness and murdered his own daughter in his rage. The other Old Gods warred against him for an age and eventually defeated him, but were unable to kill him. They split his essence into seven ""aspects"" which they scattered across the Multiverse

- Without Olgrun, Urgrund fell into war. At the heart of this conflict was Lokee, god of mischief and bastard son of the chief god Wotan, who became the first god of evil. The conflict between the forces of good and evil escalated until Ragnarok came that saw GodWorld being torn asunder in a great explosion where the gods perished.

- One of the weapons used in the titanic conflict of the Old Gods, Mageddon the Anti-Sun, is imprisoned in a gravity sink on the outer curve of spacetime.

- Massacre of Sector 666

- King Kull was the ruler of a race of protohumans known as the Submen, a race which ruled the Homo Sapiens until eventually overthrown in a revolt. As a result, Kull locked himself in a state of suspended animation.

- The Oan race splits along gender lines. The females become known as the Zamarons and leave Oa. They temporarily settle on the planet Korugar as its rulers.

**1 Billion years ago**

- The dark dreams of a cosmic entity give rise to a new dimension called Darkworld. Certain godlike beings were created along with it: Chief among these beings were Weaver, guardian &amp; master of multi-colored threads of magical energy; Chaon, twisted god of evil &amp; chaos; Gemimn, goddess of order; Tynan, cosmic balancer of order &amp; chaos; Deedra, goddess of nature; and Jheryl, goddess of truth &amp; knowledge.

- A race of shaggy blue-furred humanoids on the planet Rann banish the evil scientist and would-be tyrant Carlon Zan into space. A time-warp transports Zan to the present day and transforms him into a radioactive menace.

- The Xan, a race of humans from another planet, establish a super-civilization on Earth, living in celestial cities built by advanced science. As a specialized builder of robots and androids, his greatest achievement is Eternal, a giant half-robot, half-android built to live forever, energized by cosmic radiation, and given the full knowledge of the Xan in his artificial brain. Incredibly wise and powerful, Eternal planned to conquer Earth for himself. Before he could do so, a cloud of space gas hit Earth, gas the Xan knew could kill them. Eternal traveled to the Earth's core to find Absorbium, the only element that could counter space gas, but the absorbium caused Eternal to be paralyzed for one billion years.",DCcomics,0,0.33
