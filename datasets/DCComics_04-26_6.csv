I Get The Feeling That Tom King Wanted To Write Superman or SuperSons Instead of Wonder Woman‚Ä¶,"I Get The Feeling That Tom King Wanted To Write A Superman or Supersons Book Instead Of Wonder Woman‚Ä¶

We‚Äôre almost 10 issues into the book and we‚Äôve seen more plot and characterization in the backup stories featuring Jon, Damien, &amp; Lizzie. 

Her villains were all taken out in less then 3 pages. WW herself has had zero character growth and seems slightly annoyed at best with the whole ‚ÄúNo Mo Amazons‚Äù thing going on. It doesn‚Äôt help that the main ‚Äúvillain‚Äù is narrating about how great she is and how badly he‚Äôs gonna lose. 

Instead of using her supporting cast, he seems much more enthusiastic about using Superman or Batman or their sons. Steve is a half-note, the Amazons are just a plot device, the gods are nonexistent and her sidekicks are just billboards at best.

Wonder Woman was in one issue during Tom‚Äôs Batman run. Superman and Batman have had their presence felt in nearly every issue whether in the background, through their progeny or them showing up in the comic period.

Tom King is a good writer but he clearly doesn‚Äôt want to write WW. He‚Äôs put 100% more effort in the backups and without the fantastic art, the run itself would be average at best.",DCcomics,0,0.37

[QUESTION] Newbie seeking advice on getting started with the current Batman/Superman &amp; Action/Detective Comics runs,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I really want to jump into the current Action Comics &amp; Detective Comics runs.¬†

For Detective Comics I have these issues:¬†1080,1081,1082,1083, haven‚Äôt read them yet. But it seems like there is too much catching up to do in order to get into these? Is there any point collecting issues after 1083 now or should I just resell them and wait until next arc, whenever it‚Äôs supposed to get started?¬†

For Action Comics I have the bizzaro story &amp; start of the house of brainiac that came out last week, so 1061,1062,1063,1064. Same question here, but at least here it seems like 3-issue arcs which is good and easy to jump in?

Lastly, I picked up the Worlds Finest 24,25 ‚Äî same question, enough to jump in or would need more context/better wait? Also, don't have any current Batman issues, but same question. 

For context, also looking to start reading the current superman run ‚Äî but for that I managed to get all issues 1-12, so hopefully there I have the full story.

Has any adaptation of the Trigon arc matched up to Teen Titans (2003)?,"By matched up I don't necessarily mean being an accurate adaptation because Teen Titans season 4 certainly wasn't accurate to the comics. But rather how good it was in quality, enjoyment, and its own spin on the ideas of the original story.

I ask because there are two Titans stories that are frequently adapted and retold again and again: The Terror of Trigon and The Judas Contract. Teen Titans 2003 did an adaptation of the latter in its second season and I certainly enjoyed it. However there's a decent bit about the Judas Contract animated movie from the DCAMU that actually have me putting it above the 2003 version and I could make a reasonable argument in its favor.

But by contrast, no adaptation I've ever seen of the Trigon arc even comes close to matching 2003's version, let alone surpassing it. While not perfect because nothing is it did a damn good job with the material and got me invested and caring about the characters and story. I'm curious if others feel the same or if you have an argument to make for other Trigon adaptions, be they Titans, the DCAMU, or some other version I'm overlooking.",DCcomics,1,0.56

Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

**To those answering**

Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to &gt;!hide spoilers!&lt; when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

Powers for batfam,"What powers would you give the members of the batfamily for example.


Batman: the ability to concentrate on multiple things at the same time allowing him to achieve true multitasking.


Nightwing: empathetic six sense basically letting him sense people‚Äôs emotions. Maybe the ability to jump a bit higher than a normal person to.


Batgirl: technopath let her speak to computers making her the ultimate woman in the chair when she becomes oracle.


Red hood: the ability to see the path projectiles will take letting him avoid gun fire better and eventually aim guns more accurately. Also maybe a very slow healing factor after he becomes red hood.


Damian: the ability to perfectly copy any move he sees another person perform like taskmaster does, also explains how he‚Äôs so good at everything as a child.

Need help with Teen Titans,"Heya!

I've recently gotten back my interest in DC comics and their animated shows, particularly the Teen Titans.

From what I know, there's the original Teen Titans, Go!, Young Justice and Titans (LA) correct? Is there any I should watch specifically or which do you think I'd enjoy the most?

Also, in terms of comics, is there any chronological order for them that I can find online or what/which comics do you recommend I start with and follow through with?

Thank you for reading this!!

Need Help Finding Comic Page!,"I believe it's from JSA? I need a comic page where Billy is explaining his powers, and he mentions Solomon. He says how he didn't study for a test thinking that the wisdom of Solomon will give him a perfect score. However, when he picked up the pencil, he was unable to do anything as Solomon's wisdom had told him that he should've just studied for the test.

"Selfishly, I'm kinda glad movies aren't so good now, because it got me into the old comics! ","I was a normie who just watched the cartoons and movies and had a great time for a while. I dont like the movies that are coming out anymore(if you like them thats great, enjoy!). But it has given me time to explore the old comics and it has been amazing reading these works of Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, Geoff Johns and all these other amazing great runs! If the movies kept being amazing, I likely would not have gotten into these comics so I am kinda glad things worked out this way.  If you like the movies though hope you keep enjoying them!
